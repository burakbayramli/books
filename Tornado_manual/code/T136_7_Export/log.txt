2% move cg to ac def
% put allmoving in  
% move apex to wing def in inpt19
% Reshuffeling input order
% More input data sanity checks
% Added geometry name to geo in inpt19
% Added project reference to geo in inpt19
% Added allmoving surface to geo in inpt19
% Added geometry Version to geo in inpt19
% Bodyinput.m moved inline with inpt19.
% Changed text in rudder deflection to show abolute setting.
% Fixed geometry plotting from geometry edit menu
% Optional Update of old geometry files added.
% Spanload plot now plots only main wing (first wing) distributions.


%Input sanity check added to state input.
%PG usage warning removed
%Switched from actually stepping into directories to loading with full path filename.
%- Should avoid crashes when user ends up in the wrong directory
%Added sanity check on loading *.mat files

%Removing Try/catch statements for code cleanup


TODO before release
*Wing rotation 2 does not rotate all TE points in latticetype 0, wo state.     !! Runtime Logic
*sanity check in rudder number.
*find static margin result plot fails
*jid slelect when cancelling menue 6
*postproc, trying to plot alphasweep with nonexistent jid - crash
*lattice inconsistent when visiting geo menu?
*trim heave
*move ref to CG
*Damping volumes
*main 9 -revdrag  edit remove
*+ find trim angle of attack

Go trough old geometry files, add new geo data.
Wing label?
CS label?
