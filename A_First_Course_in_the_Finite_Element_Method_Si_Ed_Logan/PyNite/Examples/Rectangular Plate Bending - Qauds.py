# This is an example of quadrilateral elements used to model a rectangular wall under uniform load.
# This example demonstrates some of the nuances of using quadrilaterals in PyNite. PyNite's
# quadrilaterals are based on an MITC4 formulation, which produces very accurate results for thick
# and thin plates for the most part. One problem however is that stress results at quadrilateral
# corners can be difficult to determine. This example highlights the issue and shows how to work
# around it.

# PyNite has another element which is a rectangular plate bending element. Usually for this type of
# problem that element is better suited, as long as the wall does not have significant transverse
# shear deformations, and the elements are not skewed. See the "Rectangular Tank Wall - 
# Hydrostatic Loads" example using that element.

# stresses from every quad framing into each node. This leads to a much more accurate contour.
# An unsmoothed plot would essentially show quad center stresses at the quad element corners.

# Note that the deflection values for the PyNite solution are slightly larger, due to transverse
# shear deformations being accounted for.

# It should be noted that even the smoothed Mx contours are off by nearly 30% from the theoretical
# solution at the wall boundaries. Because there are no adjacent quads at the boundaries, PyNite
# cannot smooth the results there, and center stresses are being reported at the boundaries
# instead of corner stresses. So what's really going on here?

# MITC4 elements are very accurate, but the internal bending stress results at the corners are not.
# They are secondary values extrapolated from the derivatives of primary values. The corner bending
# stresses appear to more accurately represent the bending stresses at the center of the element.
# While corner STRESSES have this problem, the corner FORCES do not. To find the bending stresses
# at the quad nodes we'll get the moment at the corner and divide it by 1/2 of the plate width to
# convert it to a stress result. Note that when we talk about quad "stresses" we're really talking
# about forces per unit length of the element.

# With 200 quads in the model, quad 101 is on the left edge of the wall at mid-height, and carries
# the maximum moment.

# Get the force vector for quad 101 for load combination '1.0W'
f_vector = model.Quads['Q101'].f('1.0W')

# Although the MITC4 element nodes are defined by the user in the order [i, j, m, n], internally
# PyNite formulates the plate in the order [m, n, i, j] to be consistent with the literature used
# to derive this element. Therefore the MITC4 element's force vector is arranged as follows:
# ************************************************************************************************************************************************************
# f vector: [[fx_m, fy_m, fz_m, mx_m, my_m, mz_m, fx_n, fy_n, fz_n, mx_n, my_n, mz_n, fx_i, fy_i, fz_i, mx_i, my_i, mz_i, fx_j, fy_j, fz_j, mx_j, my_j, mz_j]]
# index:    [[  0 ,   1 ,   2 ,   3 ,   4 ,   5 ,   6 ,   7 ,   8 ,   9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  20 ,  21 ,  22 ,  23 ]]
# ************************************************************************************************************************************************************
# nomenclature: fx_n = force in the local x-direction at the n-node
#               my_j = moment about the local y-axis at the j-node

# We are interested in the moment applied to the i-node about the quad's local y-axis (my_i). This
# is at index 16 in the f vector. Note that here Mx is the moment about the local y-axis, rather
# than about it's local x-axis. This can be confusing, but is a commonly used plate nomenclature.
Mx = f_vector[16, 0]

# We can find the max My moment similarly from quad 6
f_vector_11 = model.Quads['Q6'].f('1.0W')
My = f_vector_11[15, 0]

# Now we'll convert these values to a force per unit length. The height and width of the plate is
# `meshsize`.
Mx = Mx/(mesh_size/2)
My = My/(mesh_size/2)

# Print the correct maximum bending moment:
print('Calculated maximum Mx (back-calculated from qaud nodal forces): ', Mx)
print('Calculated maximum My (back-calculated from qaud nodal forces): ', My)

# These values are much closer to the Timoshenko solution than the direct stress results. The Mx
# solution is within 1%, and the My solution is within about 6%. That is very good convergence for
# the 1'x1' mesh size. If the mesh size is reduced to 0.5' the My solution is within about 4% of
# the Timoshenko solution. It should also be remembered that even the Timoshenko solution is an
# estimate.
