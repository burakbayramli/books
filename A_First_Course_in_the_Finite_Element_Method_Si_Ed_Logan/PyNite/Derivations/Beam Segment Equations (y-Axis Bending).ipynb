    "Loading along a beam is not always mathematically continuous.  Concentrated forces and moments, as well as starting and ending points of distributed loads interupt the mathematical continuity of the beam.  For this reason, it is convenient to segment the beam between discontinuities to form a series of mathematically continuous segments. This allows for the direct calculation of maximum/minimum forces, rotations, and deflections in each segment.\n",

Likewise, the initial conditions for the third segment can be derived from the second segment, and so on until the last segment.  Any concentrated loads at the end of the last segment (including reactions) will need to be added to get shear and moment diagrams to close.\n"
