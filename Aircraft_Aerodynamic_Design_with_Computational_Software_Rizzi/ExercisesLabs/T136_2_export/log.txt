% move cg to ac def
% put allmoving in  
% move apex to wing def in inpt19
% Reshuffeling input order
% More input data sanity checks
% Added geometry name to geo in inpt19
% Added project reference to geo in inpt19
% Added allmoving surface to geo in inpt19
% Added geometry Version to geo in inpt19
% Bodyinput.m moved inline with inpt19.
% Changed text in rudder deflection to show abolute setting.
% Fixed geometry plotting from geometry edit menu
% Optional Update of old geometry files added.
% Spanload plot now plots only main wing (first wing) distributions.

%Input sanity check added to state input.
%PG usage warning removed


TODO
Wing rotation 2 does not rotate all TE points in latticetype 0, wo state.     !! Runtime Logic
sanity check in rudder number.

Go trough old geometry files, add new geo data.
Wing label?
CS label?
