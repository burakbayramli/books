      "Regular Expressions\n",
      "-------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Regular expressions (regexes or re\u2019s) constitute an extremely powerful, flexible and concise language for matching elements in text ranging from a few characters to complex patterns. While mastering the syntax of the regular expression language does require climbing a learning curve, this learning curve is not particularly steep, and a newcomer can find herself performing useful tasks with regular expressions almost immediately. Efforts spent learning regular expressions quickly pay off--tasks that are well suited for regular expressions abound. Indeed, regular expressions are one of the most useful computer skills, and an absolutely critical tool for data scientists. \n",
      "\n",
      "This document will present basic regular expression syntax and cover common use cases for regular expressions: pattern matching, filtering, data extraction, and string replacement. We will present examples using python\u2019s standard [re regular expression library](http://docs.python.org/library/re.html). All regular expressions presented below will be so-called \"perl\" regular expressions, named after the programming language that made them popular. This regular expression syntax is now very common, being use in python and many other regular expression systems. This syntax is also available in [grep](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19hbaJ-s5JaTw9YOgeWthBxODQnSOXERwOyB-4ws_D0g) using the -P flag [1], and the grep alternative [ack](http://betterthangrep.com/). The input to a regular expression can be just about any kind of text imaginable, from long documents to values of a variable in a particular operation in your program.\n",

      "###Regular Expression Basics\n",
      "\n",
      "The language used by regular expressions includes both ordinary and special characters. Upper and lower case letters and all digits (the alphanumeric characters) are all treated literally--if you search for `\"foo\"`, you will match \"food\", \"fool\", \"foot\" and \"foosball\", all strings containing \"foo\". The simplest regular expressions are just searches for a plain alphanumeric \"needles\" in some text \"haystack\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Many punctuation characters have special meanings in regular expressions. If you wish to match the punctuation character literally, you must escape it with a `\"\\\"`. For instance, if you want to match a period (a special symbol, as we will see) you would look for `\"\\.\"` Below are some of the special characters used in regular expressions. Regular expression syntax is actually pretty vast, way too extensive to cover here. Instead, we present some of the most useful and common characters. Links to more information will be provided below.\n",
      "\n",
      "* `+`: Match one or more of the preceding character or group.\n",
      "* `*`: Match zero or more of the preceding character or group.\n",
      "* `?`: Match zero or one of the preceding character or group.\n",
      "* `*?`, `+?`, `??`: ordinarily, `*`, `+` and `?` are greedy, matching the longest possible string that satisfies the regular expression. Adding the `?` to any of these makes it non-greedy, instead matching the shortest possible expression. \n",
      "* `.`: Matches any character except newline.\n",
      "* `$`: Matches the end of a string (or before a newline character that ends a string). In re's multiline mode, matches the end of each line.\n",
      "* `^`: Matches the beginning of a string (or after a newline character that ends a string). In re's multiline mode, matches the start of each line.\n",
      "* `{k}`: matches exactly k occurrences of the preceding character or group. \n",
      "* `{j,k}`: greedily match between j or k occurrences of the preceding character or group. (use `?` to use non-greedy matching).\n",
      "* `{j,}`: greedily match for at least j occurrences of the preceding character or group. (use `?` to use non-greedy matching).\n",
      "* `|`: used to denote _or_. The regular expression `a|b` will look for either a or b. This works when a and b are any character or group.\n",
      "* `( )`: Parentheses are used to denote a group. The regular expression in the parentheses can be used in combination with any of the special characters above (and many not listed here). The text that is matched by this group is captured, usable in subsequent steps in the regular expression or available to the program outside the regex.\n",
      "* `(?: )`: A non-capturing group. This works just as above, but doesn\u2019t hold on to the matched contents.\n",
      "* `(?<=x)`: Matches any string that is preceded by x (an arbitrary regular expression).\n",
      "* `[ ]`: square braces are used to indicate a set of characters. Any character in this set can be matched. For instance, `[abc]` can match either a, b, or c. Combined with modifiers above, it can match combinations of many of these three. Ranges of characters can also be specified in these sets. For instance, `[A-Z]` matches all uppercase letters, `[a-z]` matches the lowercase, and `[0-9]` matches the digits. These can be combined: `[A-Za-z0-9]`. A character set can be negated by leading with a ^ character. for instance `[^abc]` will match anything but a, b, or c. Note that most special characters lose their meaning in these groups, they are treated literally. \n",
      "* `\\d`: matches the digits, 0-9.\n",
      "* `\\D`: matches anything but `\\d`.\n",
      "* `\\w`: matches any alphanumeric character plus underscore: `[A-Za-z0-9_]`.\n",
      "* `\\W`: matches anything but `\\w`.\n",
      "* `\\s`: matches any whitespace character: `[ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v]`.\n",
      "* `\\S`: matches anything but `\\s`.\n",
      "* `\\b`: matches the breaks between alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric characters (an empty string), the boundary between `\\w` and `\\W`. Useful for ensuring that what you match is actually a word.\n",
      "* `\\B`: matches anything but `\\b`. Useful for ensuring your match is in the middle of a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "These special characters combined with ordinary strings make up the building blocks of the regular expression syntax. In Python\u2019s re library, these components are sequenced together into a string in the desired order to define the pattern being sought. Once a regular expression is defined, it is passed as the first argument in re\u2019s match function: "

      "In addition to simple matching and filtering, many regular expressions implementations, including python\u2019s re, provide a powerful mechanism for extracting meaningful data from raw text. Through capturing, those strings that satisfy a particular regular expression are extracted from the text being matched, and returned to the program processing the raw data. The portion of regular expressions that should be captured is surrounded by parentheses, `\"( )\"`. Then, provided the regular expression containing the capturing statement is satisfied, the result of the regular expression will contain a group of text matching patterns. This group method gets the results of the portions of the input text matched by the capturing statements in the regular expression. The matches are indexed from one-- to get the portion of the text matched by first capturing statement, you could query `result.group(1)`, the second parentheses will have its match stored in `result.group(2)`, etc. The value stored at `result.group(0)`, is the entire portion of the input string matched by the regular expression, not just the portion satisfying the capturing parentheses.\n",
