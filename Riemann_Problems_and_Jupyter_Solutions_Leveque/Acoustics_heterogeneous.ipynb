The materials in acoustic equations are modeled by the density and bulk modulus coefficients. The natural generalization of constant-coefficient acoustic equations is to have spatially dependent coefficients, so the equations take the form $q_t+A(x)q_x=0$. The explicit form is given by\n",

An acoustics equation for heterogeneous media in conservative form can be derived in terms of the momentum and strain. However, that is a particular case of the elasticity equations, which are explored in detail in other sections of this book. Furthermore, it is convenient to use the pressure and velocity as variables since they are continuous at interfaces between materials, and they are also more physically intuitively. It is also important to recognize that more complicated systems emerging in applications might not be written in conservation form. Therefore, studying these problems might provide insight and algorithms on how to solve more complicated cases.\n",

The Riemann problem to solve consists of the acoustic equations Riemann problem with discontinuous initial data and coefficients (discontinuous $\\rho$ and $K$).

    "We repeat the shock tube problem for acoustics but now with two materials. The material properties in the acoustic equations are defined by the density and bulk modulus. Therefore, we can solve the acoustics Riemann problem for two materials by simply choosing different densities and bulk modulus and on the left and on the right. This Riemann problem is fundamental to model acoustic wave propagation across interfaces or heterogenous materials. Note the symmetry of the wave speeds is lost since the eigenvalues are the sound speed and the sound speed depends on the material, i.e. on the density and bulk modulus, like shown in equation (\\ref{eq:achetero}). Also note the characteristics bend when crossing the origin. This is a consequence of having differente materials on the left and right sides since different materials will yield different sound speeds."

    "### Problem 4: Acoustic propagation through a wall\n",
    "In a previous example, we showed the flow into a wall, which basically models the wall as a completely reflective surface. In most cases, this is a good approximation for the reflected waves; however, we could also ask what is the propagated acoustic wave through the wall. We can answer this question by using the air's bulk modulus and density in the right side and the wall's density and bulk modulus on the right. Air actually has density of $\\rho \\approx 1 kg/m^3$ and $K\\approx 100 kPa$, steel on the other hand has $\\rho\\approx 8000 kg/m^3$ and $K=160 GPa$. Considering the atmospheric pressure to be $p_{atm} = 101325 Pa$, and an acoustic wave hitting the steel at $340 m/s$, we have all the parameters. As expected you will notice the acoustic wave\n",
