    "It is evident that the solution consists of a single right-going shock.  The exact solution cannot be seen because it coincides exactly with the Roe solution.  The path of the shock in the first plot also cannot be seen since it is plotted under the path of the rightmost Roe solution wave.  The two solutions differ only in the wave speeds predicted for the other two waves, but since these waves have zero strength this makes no difference."

As in the case of the shallow water equations, here too this behavior can lead to unphysical solutions when this approximate solver is used in a numerical discretization.  In order to correct this, we can split the single wave into two when a transonic rarefaction is present, in a way similar to what is done in the shallow water equations.  We do not go into details here."
