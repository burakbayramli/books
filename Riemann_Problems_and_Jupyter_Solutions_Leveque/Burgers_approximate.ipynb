This fictitious shock is not entropy-satisfying, but as long as it's traveling entirely to the left or entirely to the right, the effect on the numerical solution will be the same as if we used a (entropy-satisfying) rarefaction wave.  This must be true since both solutions are conservative and so averaging the wave over the single cell it affects must give the same value.  The numerical flux is again $F^*=f(q_\\ell)$ if $s\\geq 0$ and $F^*=f(q_r)$ if $s \\leq 0$."
