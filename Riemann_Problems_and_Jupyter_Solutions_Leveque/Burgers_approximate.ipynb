This fictitious shock is not entropy-satisfying, but as long as it's traveling entirely to the left or entirely to the right, the effect on the numerical solution will be the same as if we used a (entropy-satisfying) rarefaction wave.  This must be true since both solutions are conservative and so averaging the wave over the single cell it affects must give the same value.
