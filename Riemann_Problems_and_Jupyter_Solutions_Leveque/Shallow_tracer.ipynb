    "# Shallow water equations with a tracer\n",
    "\n",
    "We can augment the shallow water equations discussed in [Shallow_water](Shallow_water.ipynb) with a quantity $\\phi(x,t)$ that measures the concentration of a tracer that is advected with the fluid motion (but has no influence on the fluid dynamics).  If $\\phi$ is measured in units of mass per unit volume (which is really per unit area of the vertical cross section in this one-dimensional example), then the mass per unit length along the $x$ axis is given by $h(x,t)\\phi(x,t)$.  The quantity $\\phi$ satisfies the variable coefficient advection equation in advective (nonconservative) form:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\phi_t(x,t) + u(x,t)\\phi_x(x,t) = 0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This equation is also called the \"color equation\", since we can think of $\\phi$ as measuring the concentration of a dye that changes the color of the water.  We will use this interpretation in the plots below.  By setting the intitial conditions $\\phi(x,0)$ to be piecewise constant with different values corresponding to different colors, we can visualize the motion of the fluid better.   We will use a dark shade of blue for the water that is initially to the left of a dam at $x=0$ and a lighter shade of blue for the water that is initially to the right.  \n",

    "(h\\phi)_t + (uh\\phi)_x = 0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This can be derived by combining the color equation with the conservation of mass equation $h_t +(hu)_x  = 0$.  Since $h\\phi$ measures the concentration of dye per unit length in $x$, and we assume molecules of dye are not created or destroyed, it makes sense that this is the conserved quantity.\n",

    "The Riemann solution for this system has 3 waves.  Two of these waves, with speeds $u\\pm c$ (where $c=\\sqrt{gh}$) are just the same waves we studied in the shallow water system.  We refer to these as the 1-wave and 2-wave, to maintain consistency with the last chapter.  The additional wave appearing in this system (the *tracer* wave) moves at the fluid velocity $u$ and carries only a jump in the tracer concentration $\\phi$.  It is our first example of what is known as a contact discontinuity or *linearly degenerate* wave.  Because the fluid velocity is constant across this wave, tracer characteristics travel parallel to the wave on either side.  Thus this family does not admit shock or rarefaction waves.  We will see another example of linear degeneracy in [Euler](Euler.ipynb) and give a more general definition at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1- and 2-waves can of course each be either a shock wave or rarefaction wave depending on the initial data, as explained in [Shallow_water](Shallow_water.ipynb), since the tracer has no effect on the structure of these waves.  Below we consider a dam break problem in which case there is one of each."
