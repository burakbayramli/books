    "In Part II of this book we present a number of *approximate Riemann solvers*.  We have already seen that for many important hyperbolic systems it is possible to work out the exact Riemann solution for arbitrary left and right states.  However, for complicated nonlinear systems, such as the Euler equations (see [Euler](Euler.ipynb)), this exact solution can only be determined by solving a nonlinear system of algebraic equations for the intermediate states and the waves that connect them.  This can be done to arbitrary precision, but only at some computational expense.  The cost of exactly solving a single Riemann problem may seem insignificant, but it can become prohibitively expensive when the Riemann solver is used as a building block in a finite volume method.  In this case a Riemann problem must be solved at every cell edge at every time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we consider a very coarse grid in one space dimension with only 100 cells and take 100 time steps, then 10,000 Riemann problems must be solved.  In solving practical problems in two or three space dimensions it is not unusual to require the solution of billions or trillions of Riemann problems. In this context it can be very important to develop efficient approximate Riemann solvers that quickly produce a sufficiently good approximation to the true Riemann solution."

    "The following points have helped to guide the development of approximate Riemann solvers:\n",
    "\n",
    " - If the solution is smooth over much of the domain, then the jump in states between neighboring cells will be very small (on the order of $\\Delta x$, the cell size) for most of the Riemann problems encountered in the numerical solution. Even if the hyperbolic system being studied is nonlinear, for such data the equations can be approximated by a linearization and we have seen that linear Riemann problems can be solved more easily than nonlinear ones.  Rather than solving a nonlinear system of equations by some iterative method, one need only solve a linear system (provided the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix are known analytically, as they often are for practical problems).  In many cases the solution of this linear system can also be worked out analytically and is easy to implement, so numerical linear algebra is not required.  \n",
    " \n",
    " - In spite of smoothness over much of the domain, in interesting problems there are often isolated discontinuities such as shock waves that are important to model accurately.  So some Riemann problems arising in a finite volume method may have large jumps between the left and right states.  Hence a robust approximate Riemann solver must also handle these cases without introducing too much error.\n",
    " \n",
    " - But even in the case of large jumps in the data, it may not be necessary or worthwhile to solve the Riemann problem exactly.  The information produced by the Riemann solver goes into a numerical method that updates the approximate solution in each grid cell and the exact  structure of the Riemann solution is lost in the process."

    "We give a short review of Riemann-based finite volume methods to illustrate what is typically needed from a Riemann solver in order to implement such methods. In one space dimension, a finite volume approximation to the solution $q(x,t_n)$ at the $n$th time step consists of discrete values $Q_j^n$, each of which can be viewed as approximating the cell average of the solution over a grid cell $x_{j-1/2} < x < x_{j+1/2}$ for some discrete grid.   The cell length $\\Delta x_j = x_{j+1/2} - x_{j-1/2}$ is often uniform, but this is not required.  Many methods for hyperbolic conservation laws are written in *conservation form*, in which the numerical solution is advanced from time $t_n$ to $t_{n+1} = t_n + \\Delta t_n$ by the explicit formula\n",

    "\n",
    "Dividing (\\ref{FVupdate}) by $\\Delta t_n$ and rearranging, this form can be viewed as a discretization of $q_t + f(q)_x = 0$, provided the numerical flux is *consistent* with the true flux $f(q)$ in a suitable manner. In particular if the $Q_i$ used in defining $F_{j-1/2}^n$ are all equal to the same value $\\bar q$, then $F_{j-1/2}^n$ should reduce to $f(\\bar q)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A big advantage of using conservation form is that the numerical method is conservative. The sum $\\sum \\Delta x_j Q_j^n$ approximates the integral $\\int q(x,t_n)\\,dx$.  Multiplying (\\ref{FVupdate}) by $\\Delta x_j$ and summing shows that at time $t_{n+1}$ this sum only changes due to fluxes at the boundaries of the region in question (due to cancellation of the flux differences when summing), a property shared with the true solution.  For problems with shock waves, using methods in conservation form is particularly important since nonconservative formulations can lead to methods that converge to discontinuous solutions that look fine but are not correct, e.g. the shock wave might propagate at entirely the wrong speed.

    "### Godunov's method\n",
    "\n",
    "Trying to compute numerical approximations to hyperbolic problems with strong shock waves is challenging because of the discontinuities in the solution --- classical interpretations of $(F_{j+1/2}^n - F_{j-1/2}^n)/\\Delta x_j \\approx \\partial f/ \\partial x$ break down, oscillations near discontinuities often appear, and methods can easily go catastrophically unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The landmark paper of Godunov <cite data-cite=\"godunov\"><a href=\"riemann.html#godunov\">(Godunov 1959)</a></cite> was the first to suggest using the solution to Riemann problems in defining the numerical flux: $F_{j-1/2}^n$ is obtained by evaluating $f(Q_{j-1/2}^*)$, where $Q_{j-1/2}^*$ is the Riemann solution evaluated along the ray $x/t = 0$ after the standard Riemann problem is solved between states $q_\\ell=Q_{j-1}^n$ and $q_r=Q_j^n$ (with the discontinuity placed at $x=t=0$ as usual in the definition of the Riemann problem). If the numerical solution is now defined as a piecewise constant function with value $Q_j^n$ in the $j$th cell at time $t_n$, then the exact solution takes this value along the cell interface $x_{j-1/2}$ for sufficiently small later times $t > t_n$ (until waves from other cell interfaces begin to interact).\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic Godunov method was developed for gas dynamics and the exact Riemann solution was used, but since only one value is used from this solution and the rest of the structure is thrown away, it is natural to use some *approximate Riemann solver* that more cheaply estimates $Q_{j-1/2}^*$.  The approximations discussed in the next few chapters are often suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Godunov's method turns out to be very robust -- because the shock structure of the solution is used in defining the interface flux, the method generally remains stable provided that the *Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) Condition* is satisfied, which restricts the allowable time step relative to the cell sizes and wave speeds by requiring that no wave can pass through more than one grid cell in a single time step.  This is clearly a necessary condition for convergence of the method, based on domain of dependence arguments, and for Godunov's method (with the exact solver) this is generally sufficient as well, as verified in countless simulations (though seemingly impossible to prove in complete generality for nonlinear systems of equations).  When the exact solution is replaced by an approximate solution, the method may not work as well, and so some care has to be used in defining a suitable approximation.\n"

    "### High-resolution methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In spite of its robustness, Godunov's method is seldom used as just described because the built-in *numerical viscosity* that gives it robustness also leads to very smeared out solutions, particularly around discontinuities, unless a very fine computational grid is used.  For the advection equation, Godunov's method reduces to the standard \"first-order upwind\" method and in general it is only first order accurate even on smooth solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A wide variety of higher order Godunov-type (i.e., Riemann solver based) methods have been developed.  One approach first reconstructs better approximations to the solution at each time from the states $Q_j^n$, e.g. a piecewise polynomial that is linear  or quadratic in each grid cell rather than constant, and then uses the states from these polynomials evaluated at the cell interfaces to define the Riemann problems.  Another approach, used in the \"wave propagation methods\" developed in <cite data-cite=\"fvmhp\"><a href=\"riemann.html#fvmhp\">(LeVeque, 2002)</a></cite>, for example, is to take the waves that come out of the Riemann solution based on the original data to also define second order correction terms.  In either case some *limiters* must generally be applied in order to avoid nonphysical oscillations in solutions, particularly when the true solution has discontinuities.  There is a vast literature on such methods; see for example many of the books cited in the [Preface](Preface.ipynb).  For our present purposes the main point is that an approximate Riemann solver is a necessary ingredient in many methods that are commonly used to obtain high-resolution approximations to hyperbolic PDEs."

One should rightly worry about whether the approximate solution generated with such a method will satisfy the required entropy condition and end up with rarefaction waves where needed rather than entropy-violating shocks, and we address this to some extent in the examples in the following chapters.  It is important to remember that we are discussing the approximate solver that will be used *at every grid interface* in every time step, and the numerical viscosity inherent in the numerical method can lead to rarefactions in the overall numerical approximation even if each approximate Riemann solution lacks rarefactions.
