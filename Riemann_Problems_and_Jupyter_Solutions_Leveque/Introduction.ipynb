    "## What is a Riemann Problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1860, Bernhard Riemann published a study titled \"On the propagation of plane waves of finite amplitude\" <cite data-cite=\"riemann1860fortpflanzung\"><a href=\"riemann.html#riemann1860fortpflanzung\">(Riemann, 1860)</a></cite>, the first mathematical analysis of the Euler equations of gas dynamics.  In that work, among many contributions, is a study of what came to be known as the **Riemann problem**: a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) with initial data consisting of two constant states separated by a discontinuity.  The idea of discontinuous solutions to hyperbolic conservation laws was first suggested by Stokes <cite data-cite=\"stokes1848liv\"><a href=\"riemann.html#stokes1848liv\">(Stokes, 1848)</a></cite>, but experts at the time shied away from this idea; Stokes' suggestion was criticized by Lords Kelvin and Rayleigh.  In focusing on a problem with discontinuous data, Riemann not only accepted this idea but placed it at the center of our understanding of hyperbolic PDEs.  This history is recounted in more detail by Dafermos (see <cite data-cite=\"dafermos2010hyperbolic\"><a href=\"riemann.html#dafermos2010hyperbolic\">(Dafermos, 2010)</a></cite>).  As stated there, \"Riemann's remarkable paper provides the foundation for the general theory of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws in one space dimension\".  That theory revolves, to a great extent, around the Riemann problem and its solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a hyperbolic system of $m$ PDEs, each of the states in the Riemann solution is a vector with $m$ components. We will generally use $q(x,t)\\in\\mathbb{R}^m$ to denote the generic solution to a hyperbolic problem in on space dimension, and denote the Riemann initial data by $q_\\ell$ for for the left state (i.e. $q(x,0) = q_\\ell$ for $x<0$) and $q_r$ for the right state  (i.e. $q(x,0) = q_r$ for $x \\geq 0$).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will formally define what we mean by a hyperbolic system of PDEs shortly, but for now it suffices to know that these are the PDEs that naturally arise whenever we model wave propagation.   The work of Riemann and Stokes was motivated by the Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics; in this introduction we use examples involving the motion of water waves. Hyperbolic equations also arise in modeling waves in solids (e.g. seismic waves), in traffic, and in many other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a model of small amplitude waves, the equations may be linear (e.g. acoustics or linear elasticity, modeling seismic waves for example).  These PDEs arise from a linear approximation to more general nonlinear hyperbolic systems that are also valid for larger amplitude waves (e.g. the Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics, or nonlinear elastic wave equations)."

    "To get a feel for what a Riemann problem and its solution look like, consider a *dam break* problem in which a dam initially separates water with constant depth $h_\\ell$ to the left of the dam from water with depth $h_r$ to the right of the dam.  Suppose the water is initially stationary, with velocity 0 on both sides of the dam.   This situation is depicted in the figure below, with water behind the dam shaded light blue and water in front of the dam shaded dark blue."

In reality we might expect the flow to be turbulent and multidimensional, but for now let us idealize this with a one-dimensional model in which the velocity is purely horizontal and is constant throughout the depth of the fluid, so for $t>0$ the velocity varies only with $x$ and $t$, given by some function $u(x,t)$, and the depth is given by $h(x,t)$.  In [Shallow_water](Shallow_water.ipynb) we will discuss the one-dimensional **shallow water equations** that can be used to model this idealized situation. \n",

The stripes with different shading are to help you visualize the flow; each stripe represents the same volume of water.  Think of the color as a dye that is simply carried along with the water as it flows.  In [Shallow_tracer](Shallow_tracer.ipynb) we will see that we can in fact model this by adding another equation to the shallow water equations for the density of a tracer."

    "### Things to note about this animation\n",
    "\n",
    " - Initially the fluid velocity $u(x,0) \\equiv 0$ at $t=0$.  For $t>0$, the water remains stationary far from away from the dam.  The region where the water is not stationary grows linearly outward from $x=0$ as $t$ increases.\n",
    " - The fluid is accelerated to the right as water starts to flow.\n",
    " - Water upstream from the dam (for $x<0$) starts to accelerate slowly as the depth of the water starts to fall, and both the depth and the velocity remain continuous functions of $x$ in this region for all time. The depth and velocity vary through a **rarefaction wave** that moves upstream.\n",
    " - The water downstream from the dam is stationary until a **shock wave** passes by, which instantaneously accelerates the fluid from $u_r=0$ to some constant velocity $u_m >0$.  At the same time the depth increases from $h_r$ to $h_m$. This *middle state* depth and velocity is the same as the depth and velocity that the light blue water upstream from the dam also reaches once it has passed through the rarefaction wave and been fully accelerated.\n",
    " - The shock wave moves at a constant velocity $s_r > u_m$.\n",
    " - The rarefaction wave spreads out as time evolves and the left and right edges move at constant velocities $\\lambda_{l1}$ and $\\lambda_{m1}$. We will see later that these speeds are eigenvalues of a certain Jacobian matrix.\n"

    "A **shock wave** is a type of wave often seen when solving nonlinear hyperbolic equations.  The solution is discontinuous across a shock wave, which means that special mathematical techniques must be used to make sense of functions like this as solutions of a differential equation.  It also means that special algorithmic techniques must be used to compute accurate numerical solutions to such equations.  Simply replacing derivatives by finite differences typically does not work well. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of water waves, this shock wave is often called a **hydraulic jump**.  In a real dam break problem the solution would not be discontinuous, but there might be turbulent bore that, from far enough away, looks like a discontinuity.  The nonlinear shallow water equations can be used to model such flows in the sense that the jump in depth and velocity and the propagation speed of the shock wave closely approximate the hydraulic jump and speed of the bore.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nonlinear shallow water equations are usually solved in terms of the variables $q = [h, hu]$, where $h$ is the depth (mass per unit length) and $hu$ is the density of momentum (per unit length).  For flow on a flat bottom these are conserved quantities, and the hyperbolic problem in this case is called a **hyperbolic conservation law**.  For nonlinear hyperbolic equations, conservation is the key to understanding the propagation of shock waves, as we will explore in several chapters."

    " - As we have just seen, even this simple initial data can lead to complicated solutions.  \n",
    " \n",
    " - However, the solution is simple enough that there is some hope we can determine it exactly, even for nonlinear systems of PDEs.\n",
    " \n",
    " - In the animation above we noted that the shock wave and the two edges of the rarefaction wave are all moving at *constant speeds*.  In fact if we plot contours of the depth (or the velocity) in the $x$-$t$ plane, we find that the value of each variable is constant along any ray $x = at$ from the origin.  In other words $h(x,t) = H(x/t)$ and $u(x,t) = U(x/t)$ for some functions $H$ and $U$ of a single variable.  The solution is said to be a **similarity solution** and this structure greatly facilitates solving the Riemann problem.  This is true even for nonlinear hyperbolic problems provided certain conditions are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Developing an understanding of how the Riemann solution behaves for all possible choices of left and right states for a hyperbolic problem is essential for understanding the behavior of more complicated solutions.\n",
    " \n",
    " - The development of mathematical theory of hyperbolic problems has relied extensively on the understanding that comes from studying Riemann problems.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Many robust numerical methods for approximating the solution with more general initial data use the Riemann solution as an essential building block.  The most basic method of this type is **Godunov's method**, described below. Numerical methods typically make use of *approximate Riemann solvers*, which are often computationally cheaper than an exact solver.\n",

    "## Phase plane plot for the shallow water equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The phase plane plot for the nonlinear shallow water equations is more interesting.  Since the eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix vary with $q$, the curves connecting states separated by a single wave are not straight lines. There is also a distinction between the curves connecting states by a shock wave and those connecting states by a rarefaction wave.  This is discussed in much more detail in [Shallow_water](Shallow_water.ipynb).  \n",

    "Below, in the notebook, or on [this webpage](http://www.clawpack.org/riemann_book/phase_plane/shallow_water_small.html), we provide an interactive view that allows you to see how the solution changes as you move the left and right states around in the phase plane. Note that for this nonlinear system the situation is much more complicated than in the linear acoustics case."
