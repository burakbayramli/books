    "We start our study with the scalar, linear hyperbolic PDE: the advection equation. The solution to this equation simply consists of the initial condition propagating with constant velocity.  We first describe the physical origin of this equation and then investigate the solution of the corresponding Riemann problem. This equation is studied in more detail e.g. in Chapter 2 of <cite data-cite=\"fvmhp\"><a href=\"riemann.html#fvmhp\">(LeVeque, 2002)</a></cite>, for example.\n",
