    "# Nearly-incompressible flow: the Tammann equation of state\n",

    "In this chapter, we consider the one-dimensional Riemann problem for the Euler equations with the Tammann equation of state (EOS). The Tammann EOS, also known as stiffened gas EOS, is used to model almost-incompressible fluids. It can be physically understood as modeling an ideal gas under very high ambient pressures. The Riemann problem we want to solve consists of the one-dimensional Euler equations,\n",

When $p_{\\infty } \\gg 1$, the Tammann EOS emulates an ideal gas at a very high pressure, which can be used to model almost-incompressible fluids like water. They are almost-incompressible because a very large change is pressure is required to produce even a small change in density.  Note the sound speed (as well as the density and any other physical quantity) is well defined for negative values of $p$, with the only limitation that $p+p_{\\infty}>0$. We will revisit this issue in [the last section of this chapter](#Strong-rarefaction-waves).\n",

    "Just as in [the earlier chapter on ideal gas flow](Euler.ipynb), the solution of the Riemann problem considered here consists of three waves.  The 1-wave and 3-wave are genuinely nonlinear (rarefactions or shocks), while the 2-wave is a linearly degenerate contact discontinuity. The solution thus includes four constant regions with solutions $q_l, q_{*l}, q_{*r}, q_r$, separated by the three waves. Just as in the case of the ideal gas, the velocity and pressure do not change across the contact wave, so we denote them simply by $u_*$ and $p_*$. Note that the interface between the fluids that were initially to the left and right of $x=0$ moves along the contact discontinuity, so if the fluid parameters $\\gamma$ and $p_\\infty$ vary between the left and right states then the this jump in parameters also moves with the contact discontinuity.  Consequently, the 1-wave propagates through left-state fluid and the 3-waves propagates through right-state fluid.  (This will be true even in the supersonic case, where all the wave speeds have the same sign.) This allows us to determine the Hugoniot loci and integral curves for these two nonlinear waves using the fact that fluid parameters $\\gamma$ and $p_\\infty$ are always constant across each of these waves.\n",

    "middle state pressure $p_*$ that ensures that the velocity $u_*$ across the contact discontinuity is consistent. Since we know that the left state velocity $u_l$ should be connected by a rarefaction or shock to $u_*$, we write $u_*=u_l + [u]_1$, where $[u]_1$ is the jump of the velocity across the 1-wave. In a similar manner, we also \n",

    "As we did in [the chapter on ideal gas flow](Euler.ipynb), here we visualize the solution in the plane whose axes are pressure and velocity. We have a left and a right state such that each one is connected to some middle state by a shock or a rarefaction, depending on the entropy conditions. The connection is established by curves in the phase plane: Hugoniot loci in the case of shocks and integral curves in the case of rarefactions. The intersection between these curves yields the middle state, which is the most important element of the solution to the Riemann problem. Let's look at an interactive plot illustrating the solution in the phase plane. The initial states and the middle state are indicated as black points; the Hugoniot loci are plotted in red and the integral curves in blue. The physical solution satisfying the entropy conditions is plotted as a continous line, whereas the unphysical solution is shown as a dashed line."

Since we have the solution for different EOS parameters in the left and right states, we can model interaction of different fluids across the interface. For instance, we can use this model to study the Riemann problem across an air-water interface. Air is modeled by the ideal gas EOS, which corresponds to $\\gamma=1.4$ and $p_{\\infty} = 0$, and water can be modeled using the same parameters as the example above. \n",

Then this wave should be partly transmitted as a shock wave moving to the right in the water, and partly reflected as a lef-going wave in the air.  If we suppose the shock wave hits the interface at time $t=0$, then we can calculate the transmitted and reflected waves by solving the Riemann problem starting at $t=0$ for a case with a positive pressure and velocity in the left state and ambient water conditions in the right state.\n",

Although in a realistic two or three dimensional setting, the water would spill into the left state, we can suppose that the water is being held in place by a container with a thin wall. In this setting, the current model has been shown to be a valid approximation <cite data-cite=\"delrazo2017\"><a href=\"riemann.html#delrazo2017\">(del Razo 2017)</a></cite>.
