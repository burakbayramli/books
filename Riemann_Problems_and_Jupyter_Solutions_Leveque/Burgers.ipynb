    "We can decompose this into two Riemann problems: one at $x=-1$ and another at $x=1$. Each of these two Riemann problems will yield either a shock or a rarefaction. The interesting part is what happens when the generated shocks or rarefactions interact. In the scenario shown below, let us assume that both Riemann problems produce a right-propagating shock. However, the shock generated at $x=-1$ propagates faster, so it will eventually reach the shock originally generated at $x=1$. At the point in time when the shocks collide, one can simply restate the problem again as a Riemann problem and solve the whole problem analytically. In this animation, the plot on the left shows the solution $q(x)$ evolving through time, while the one on the right shows the characteristic structure in the $x-t$ plane, with the shocks shown as wide lines and the characteristics as thin lines, and with time is marked by a horizontal dashed line. In this animation, one can clearly see the two shocks merge to become a single shock at later times.  This animation can be viewed in the live notebook on or [this webpage](http://www.clawpack.org/riemann_book/html/burgers_animation1.html)."

The animation below, or on [this webpage](http://www.clawpack.org/riemann_book/html/burgers_animation2.html), shows how a right-propagating shock can overtake a rarefaction.
