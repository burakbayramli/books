    "Our next example is something you can experiment with in your own home.  Go to the kitchen sink, position the faucet over a flat part of the sink (not over the drain), and turn it on.  Carefully examine the flow of water in the sink.  You will see that near the jet of water coming from the faucet, there is a region of very shallow, very fast-flowing water.  Then at a certain distance, the water suddenly becomes deeper and slower moving.  This jump is relatively stable and will approximately form a circle if the bottom of the sink is flat around the area under the faucet.\n",

You might be wondering whether this steady solution is dynamically stable -- i.e., whether the flow will converge to this state if it is initially different.  The answer is yes; in fact, any boundary data that implies a transition from supercritical to subcritical flow will lead to a hydraulic jump.  In the example below, we impose such boundary data but initialize $h$ and $u$ with constant values, to show the emergence of the jump."
