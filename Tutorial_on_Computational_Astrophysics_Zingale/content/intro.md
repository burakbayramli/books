Introduction
============

This is a collection of notebooks on computational (astro)physics,
used to introduce finite-volume methods for solving the Euler equations.

Starting at the beginning, these notebooks introduce numerical methods
for derivatives, intergration, rooting finding, and ODEs, focusing
on the parts that we will need to solve the equations of hydrodynamics.

The next set of notebooks begin with the linear advection equation
and then onto the compressible Euler equations.

By clicking on the "rocket ship" icon, you can launch the notebook
in google colab or binder to run it in the cloud.
