PURPOSE

The enclosed Pascal source code implements the NORAD SGP4/SDP4 orbital 
models for use with the standard two-line orbital element sets to 
determine earth- centered inertial (ECI) and topocentric coordinates of 
earth-orbiting objects. This code implements both the near-earth and 
deep-space portions of the NORAD SGP4 orbital model.  These units are 
designed to make the development of programs based on the NORAD orbital 
models straightforward and standardized.


INTRODUCTION

In order to properly determine the position of any earth-orbiting object 
using the standard NORAD two-line element sets, it is necessary that the 
proper orbital model be used.  Since the observations taken by NORAD for 
each earth-orbiting object are reduced to orbital elements using the 
SGP4 (Simplified General Perturbations) model, the SGP4 model *MUST* be 
used to get the most accurate determination possible of an object's 
position and velocity.  The primary reason for this requirement is that 
each orbital model handles perturbations (due to atmospheric drag, solar 
and lunar gravitational effects, irregularities of the earth's 
gravitational field, etc.) in a different manner.  The NORAD two-line 
element sets incorporate these perturbations using the SGP4 orbital 
model and that model is required to accurately reconstruct the 
magnitudes of these effects.

The SGP4 orbital model takes into account perturbations due to 
atmospheric drag (based on a static, non-rotating, spherically-symmetric 
atmosphere whose density can be described by a power law), fourth-order 
zonal geopotential harmonics (J2, J3, and J4), spin-orbit resonance 
effects for synchronous and semi-synchronous orbits, and solar and lunar 
gravitational effects to first order.  The two portions of the SGP4 
model are SGP4 (for objects in orbits with periods less than 225 
minutes) and SDP4 (for objects in orbits greater than or equal to 225 
minutes).  The reason for breaking the model into two parts is that for 
low-earth orbits the effects of spin-orbit resonance and lunar and solar 
gravity are not significant.  This result allows the development of an 
analytical model (SGP4) for determining an object's position and 
velocity, thereby reducing the computational burden.  For deep-space 
orbits, a semi-analytical model (SDP4) is required.

Models which implement the older SGP model should be accurate for 
low-earth orbits but really won't be adequate for deep-space objects, 
particularly those in resonance with the geopotential.


COMPUTER IMPLEMENTATION

The enclosed Pascal source code was developed in Turbo Pascal Version 
7.0 to fully implement the NORAD SGP4 orbital model.  There are now 
twelve units provided:

     SGP4SDP4     Full implementation of NORAD SGP4/SDP4 models
     SGP_OBS      Observer-dependent routines for calculating 
                  topocentric information
     MINMAX       Minimum/maximum functions
     SGP_MATH     Various trigonometric and mathematical routines
     SGP_TIME     Time-based routines for converting among time systems
     SGP_INIT     Code and variables needed to initialize SGP4SDP4
     SGP_INTF     Interface between SGP4SDP4 and SGP_CONV (and some 
                  special-purpose programs)
     SGP_CONV     Routines for converting two-line data and SGP4 state 
                  vectors
     SGP_IN       Routines to simplify input of data (with error checking)
     SGP_OUT      Routines for outputting program results in standard 
                  formats
     SOLAR        Routines for calculating the position of the sun and 
                  whether a satellite is in earth umbral eclipse
     SUPPORT      General support routines for machine-dependent features

These units are structured to make development of software as simple as 
possible and to reduce the time needed for validating results.  A more 
complete description of these Pascal units is included in INTRFACE.TXT.

Of the units provided, the most complex is the implementation of the 
NORAD orbital models (SGP4SDP4).  The development of this unit was done 
to follow as closely as possible the implementation contained in 
Spacetrack Report Number 3, "Models for Propagation of NORAD Element 
Sets," (a copy of the LaTeX documentation and complete FORTRAN source 
code is available on the CelesTrak WWW site in the Documentation 
section). No attempt has been made at this point to optimize the code to 
run faster.  A future release will provide a more streamlined 
implementation.  To ensure the validity of these units, no changes 
should be made to the units themselves which have been extensively 
tested and validated.

A test program (SGP4TEST.PAS) is included to implement the sample cases 
included in the Spacetrack Report Number 3 documentation. This test 
program should provide a reasonably good idea of how to use these Turbo 
Pascal units.  To determine an object's position and velocity, the 
object's two-line orbital element set is read into the array {sat_data} 
[Note:  Variable names will be enclosed within braces to set them apart 
in this document].  A call is then made to the procedure 
Convert_Satellite_Data passing the satellite's index {satnumber}. In the 
call to this procedure, a determination is automatically made as to 
whether the object is in a near-earth or deep-space orbit; the result is 
returned in {ideep}.  If {ideep} is 0, then the object is in a 
near-earth orbit; if {ideep} is 1, it is in a deep-space orbit.  A call 
is then made to either SGP4 or SDP4 depending on the value of {ideep}.

The time passed in this call, {tsince}, represents the time since 
(before or after) the satellite epoch in the two-line element set.  The 
four-dimensional vectors {pos} and {vel} are returned containing the x, 
y, and z ECI coordinates (referenced to the true equator and mean 
equinox of date) and vector magnitude of the object's position and 
velocity, respectively, at the specified time.  Units are earth radii 
and earth radii per minute, respectively; appropriate conversions must 
be made to get the proper units (as demonstrated in the test program 
using Convert_Sat_State).  The variable {iflag} is used internally for 
keeping track of initialization conditions for the deep-space portion of 
the model.

Running this test program should provide results quite close to those 
provided in the Spacetrack Report Number 3 documentation (see 
SGP4-VAL.TXT and SDP4-VAL.TXT).  The minor differences that do occur are 
due to two primary reasons.  The first is the result of differences in 
the internal precision of the FORTRAN compiler used to generate the 
report and that of the Turbo Pascal compiler.  The second is due to the 
choice to implement a consistent numerical precision in the Turbo Pascal 
code. Examination of the FORTRAN source code will reveal inconsistent 
use of single- and double-precision variables and trigonometric 
functions; the Turbo Pascal code uses double-precision variables and 
functions throughout.

Because it is not very straightforward to perform calls to the SGP4 
units based on the time since each satellite's element set epoch, a 
procedure is also provided which interfaces between a standard time 
system and the SGP4 and SDP4 calls.  This procedure, SGP, requires only 
that the user pass the Julian Date of interest; the procedure 
Julian_Date_of_Epoch converts from a date in the format used in the 
two-line element set to a Julian Date.  The SGP call also takes care of 
making the determination of whether the object is in a near-earth or 
deep-space orbit and calls the appropriate model.  The SGP_TIME unit 
contains these procedures as well as routines to convert Julian Dates to 
more recognizable time formats.

The main advantage of using the Julian Date in SGP is that there is no 
problem calculating the time interval between the time of interest and 
the satellite element set epoch, regardless of whether this interval 
spans the beginning of a year.  There is also a function to convert 
Julian Dates to calendar dates (Calendar_Date) of the form "1999 Nov 
30."  Epoch_Time transforms the Julian Dates to the form used in the 
two-line element sets.

The test program SGP4TST2.PAS gives an example implementation of this 
approach.  It is designed to produce the same results as SGP4TEST.PAS.  
The main difference is that the Julian Date is calculated to be the time 
of the epoch for each element set and then the offset (in minutes) is 
added.  Be sure to note that times outside the units are now all in 
*days* not in minutes (as they are inside the units).


CONCLUSION

These Turbo Pascal units should make it easy to implement the official 
NORAD orbital models in developing any number of applications.  It is 
now very straightforward to select input files (of satellite and 
observer data) and time conditions (with full error checking) and output 
data ranging from spacecraft ECI position and velocity to spacecraft 
ground tracks (latitude, longitude, and altitude) to look angles 
(azimuth, elevation, range, and range rate) to right ascension and 
declination.  Each of these outputs uses the WGS '72 geoid 
(nonspherical) and takes into account atmospheric refraction, where 
appropriate.  These results can be easily output as text or incorporated 
into advanced graphical applications.

For a full-blown example of how to implement these functions, look for 
the application TrakStar/SGP4, also available on the CelesTrak WWW site.  
It allows output for up to 250 satellites (or element sets for a single 
satellite) in the form of spacecraft ECI position and velocity, 
spacecraft ground tracks (latitude, longitude, and altitude), look 
angles (azimuth, elevation, range, and range rate), and right ascension 
and declination.  A separate data file is created for each 
object/element set--a great tool for all sorts of analyses.

Future releases of these units will include routines to efficiently 
determine crossing phenomena (e.g., satellite rise/set, sun rise/set, 
and satellite entry into/exit from earth eclipse) and local optima 
(e.g., closest approach).

In a continuing effort to promote standardization of orbital 
calculations, I will endeavor to continue to improve this package and 
will gratefully accept user feedback or contributions to this effort.
