# Numerical Conservation Laws

This repository contains Python and MATLAB scripts for implementing high-order finite volume and finite difference methods for nonlinear conservation laws and systems of conservation laws. We cover
* TVD/TVB slope limiters
* WENO finite volume and finite difference schemes

applied to scalar conservation laws and systems of conservation laws in one and two dimension. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites



```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
