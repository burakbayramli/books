# Non-linear-dynamics-Strogatz

This subject area is something that I have found needs intuition, luck
(aka other's solutions) and visualisation for me to process the deeper
elements. I found reading Gleik's book first, then Sayama (who also
supplies useful Python code) a nice preparatory. Of course, the
assumption of strong LA and Calculus is taken as read. Writing code
helps make clear descriptions that seem, but are not, concretised in
one's mind. The code is made available to use in both script and
Jupyter notebooks. There is also some other code I modified from
Sayama. I don't like the animation he uses and so rewrote for
FuncAnimation in matplotlib. I like scripts for specific tasks for a
lot of reasons, but in this case for the reason one can create
individualised notebooks if you want using the ```%load``` magic.

Of all of the code within, my favourite is the beautiful mayavi
animation of the Lorenz system.
