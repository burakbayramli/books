<b>Welcome to the Magic Software web site!</b>  Quite likely you are here to
access our free source code and documentation.  The code base originated in
1991 to provide support for the technical news group
<i>comp.graphics.algorithms.</i>  Although the initial emphasis was on
computer graphics, over the years the source code base has evolved to assist
in problem solving in other fields including games programming, image
analysis, and numerical methods.

<b>Books</b>.
The source code at this site is free.  Show your support by purchasing one
of our <a target="_parent" href="Books.html">books</a> published by
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mkp.com">Morgan Kaufmann Publishers</a>.
The royalties are used by the company to produce more free source code.
Two books currently available are <i>3D Game Engine Design</i>, a book on
building a graphics engine for games, and <i>Geometric Tools for Computer
Graphics</i>, a book on useful topics that arise frequently in computer
graphics.  The next book is <i>Game Physics</i> and will be available near
the end of 2003.  This book is on the topic of physics and its implementation
in a game development environment.

<b>Source Code</b>.  The bulk of the content at this site is source code
and documentation.  We call the collective package the
<i>Wild Magic engine</i>.  The current version is 2.11 and was released on
October 21, 2003.  Please read the
<a target="_blank" href="License/WildMagic.pdf">license agreement</a>
before downloading
<a target="_parent" href="SourceCode.html">source code</a>.  Bug fixes and
updates are posted to the update history page that is available at the source
code page.  Our source code is portable and runs on Microsoft Windows
machines (9x/NT/2000/XP), Linux machines, and the Macintosh (OS 10.2.x and
later).  The graphics code contains a GLUT renderer that works on all
platforms.  On MS Windows we have renderers for Direct X and OpenGL (wgl).
On the Macintosh we have OpenGL (agl).  The graphics engine has both vertex
shader and pixel shader support.  Zip files containing the full distribution
are available at the source code page; StuffIt files are available for the
Macintosh.
