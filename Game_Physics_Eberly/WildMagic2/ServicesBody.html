Magic Software provides various services to the technical community.  Our
main areas of expertise are computer graphics (including games programming),
image analysis, and numerical methods.  We provide contract programming,
on-site consulting, and training in these areas.  We also provide support
services such as performance analysis, testing, and debugging of
applications.
<br><br>

A current and ongoing project is algorithm development for the
<a target="_blank" href="http://mipav.cit.nih.gov">
Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization
</a>
package that is developed by researchers at the National Institutes of Health.
The package is written in Java and Java3D.  Recent algorithms that we
provided for the package:
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Level surface extraction</b>.  Uses either a Marching Tetrahedra
    algorithm or a topologically correct algorithm for rectangular lattices.
    <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Decimation of triangle meshes</b>.  The meshes have millions of
    triangles.  Uses a Garland-Heckbert-style algorithm.
    <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="Services/SurfaceViewer.html">Level surface viewer</a>.  A
    Java3D application for viewing lit triangle meshes that represent level
    surfaces.
    <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="Services/VolumeRendering.html">Volume rendering</a>.
    Based on software ray tracing.
    <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="Services/ShearWarp.html">Volume rendering</a>. Based on
    shear-warp factorization.
    <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="Services/BrainExtraction.html">Brain extraction tool</a>.  A
    coarse-level 3D magnetic resonance image segmentation called skull
    stripping.
    <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Adaptive skeleton climbing</b>.  Postprocessing an extracted level
    surface mesh using triangle decimation is time consuming since the meshes
    tend to have on the order of one million triangles.  Skeleton climbing 
    allows you to quickly build a multiresolution level surface during the
    extraction phase.  The multiple resolutions are constructed by a bottom-up
    voxel merging method that is based on sign changes of the voxel data minus
    the desired level surface value.
    <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Volume rendering</b> using hardware-supported 3D texturing.
    <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Virtual colonoscopy</b>.  A 3D graphics application that allows a user
    to do a fly-through of the tube surface obtained from a segmentation of
    a colonoscopy data set.  The tube is vertex colored, the colors associated
    with the mean curvature of the surface.  The goal is to identify polyps
    that are potentially malignant.  Such polyps show up as large curvature
    protrusions/invaginations of the surface.  The vertex coloring helps
    draw the user's attention when performing the fly-through.
    <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Fine-level segmentation and analysis of the cortical surface</b>.  The
    input is a segmented, skull-stripped brain data set.  The segmentation
    used a fuzzy C-means algorithm to identify white matter, gray matter,
    cerebral spinal fluid, and background.  A surface evolution scheme is
    used to produce a good quality triangle mesh that approximates the folds
    of the brain.  The evolution is set up to prevent self-intersection of the
    mesh.  The final surface is then mapped to a sphere (called <i>surface
    inflation</i> to allow a user to study regions of interest of the cortical
    surface.  The mapping is conformal (local angles are preserved) and
    designed to minimize metric distortion.  This allows a spherical
    coordinate system to be assigned to the cortical surface.
  </li>
</ul>
Algorithms for this project currently in development include:
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Viewport-aligned volume rendering</b>.  Use hardware-supported
    texturing, but software-generated image slices that are aligned to
    the view direction.
    <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>3D Face anonymizer</b>.  Modify enough information of a 3D image of
    the head to prevent a user of a surface or volume renderer from
    recognizing the face.
    <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Virtual endoscopy</b> A fly-through of tube surface with branches,
    for example, brachial tubes.  This project also involves occlusion
    culling of the segmented data set to speed up the rendering during the
    fly-through.
    <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Nonlinear registration of 3D images</b>.  Two 3D images, an affine
    registration is performed; rotation, translation, and scaling are used
    to register the images.  This registration is used as the starting point
    for another registration that is based on B-spline volume functions.
  </li>
</ul>

Selected projects that we have also worked on include:
<ul>
  <li>
    Least-squares fitting of data by ellipsoids to assist in the calibration
    of devices that make 3D measurements dependent on the Earth's magnetic
    field.
    <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    Modeling of coalition behavior of political parties.  The parties are
    represented as 3D ellipsoids in a feature space, in the style of
    statistical pattern recognizition where the features are party beliefs.
    Coalitions are possible if the ellipsoids intersect.  We produced
    algorithms and code in Java for fast and accurate intersection of convex
    polyhedra that represent ellipsoids and intersection of ellipsoids.
    <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    Debugging and performance testing/improvment for a 3D F1 car racing game
    for a prominent game company.
    <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    Development and implementation of 2D facial animations in the style of
    nonphotorealistic rendering.
