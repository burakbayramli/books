  The privacy statement for the Magic Sofware web site is quite simple:
  <ul>
    <li>
      We do not use cookies.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is no hidden monitoring of mouse clicks on advertising links for
      the purposes of obtaining marketing information and consumer
      preferences.  In fact, the only advertising at our site is
      self-referential.  You will find no blinking advertisments here!
    </li>
    <li>
      The web site is hosted by Earthlink and runs on top of an Apache
      server.  As part of the web hosting package, we are able to download
      the server web logs that have a record of the activity at this site.
      The logs are used by us for the following purposes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The main logs are used to collect statistics on how often content
          files such as source files and PDF documentation are accessed.  The
          information is used for the purposes of (1) deciding which topics
          are the most popular so that we can focus our efforts on those
          topics for future source code development and (2) deciding which
          files are infrequently accessed so that we can consider removing
          them from the site.
        </li>
        <li>
          The error logs are used to identify bad or stale links at the site
          so that we can fix them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      No high-level processing of the web logs is done for the purposes of
      inferring the browsing preferences of folks that visit our site.
    </li>
    <li>
      Email addresses of folks that contact us are <i>never</i> provided to
      anyone else, especially to companies that like to assemble lists of
      addresses and sell them to other companies.
    </li>
    <li>
      This site is safe for children!  Well, okay, there is the potential for
      distress if your child has a severe phobia of mathematics...
    </li>
  </ul>
