People that have had a significant hand or two in Wild Magic development.
The list is in alphabetical order by last name.
<ul>
<li>Dario Accornero (adario@cs.bu.edu):  Macintosh development, renderers,
  application layers, tools, development environment, and other
  Apple-related support. <br><br>
</li>
<li>George Innis (Magic Software, Inc.):  Implementation of the LCP solver
in the physics code.  Implementation of the distance calculators for polygons
in 2D and polyhedra in 3D. <br><br>
</li>
<li>Daragh McDonnell (MIT Multimedia Lab Europe):  The
original implementation of the Direct 3D renderer and the implementation of
the 3D Studio Max exporter.  He also wrote a Direct Sound 3D audio renderer,
but I have never posted it. <br><br>
</li>
<li>Tim Preston (http://homepage.mac.com/tpreston): The original port of
  Wild Magic to the Macintosh and a few develoment environment issues.
  <br><br>
</li>
<li>Nolan Walker (Computer Science Department, The University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill):  Implementation of many of the intersection code
for 3D objects.  Added support to the scene graph management system for
vertex and pixel shaders.  Extended the Direct 3D and OpenGL renderer code
to support shaders.  Implemented a nifty Cg converter tool to compile shader
programs into a format that Wild Magic loads.  All of the Wild Magic shader
applications were written by him. <br><br>
</li>
<li>Hans Weber (magic@the-webers.org):  Extended the scene graph management
system and the OpenGL renderers to support high-level rendering effects
(bump maps, environment maps, gloss maps, light maps, planar reflections,
planar shadows, polygon offset, projected textures, specular after texture,
combine modes). <br><br>
</li>
<li>Dennis Wenzel (Magic Software, Inc.):  Extended the Direct 3D renderer
to support high-level rendering effects (bump maps, environment maps, gloss
maps, light maps, planar reflections, planar shadows, polygon offset,
projected textures, specular after texture, combine modes).

  MindGames is a research group in
  <a href="http://www.mle.ie">Media Lab Europe</a>
  (based in Dublin, Ireland), the European research partner of the MIT Media
  Lab. The goal of the group is to develop novel tools and technologies which
  will allow people to learn beneficial new skills in a virtual environment,
  in such a way that those skills are retained in, and can be applied to,
  &#8220;real-world&#8221; situations. In particular, the group seeks to
  harness the delight and pleasure that children take in video gaming, to
  produce a powerful new therapeutic medium for a variety of psychological
  disorders.
  </font></p>
  <p><font size=2 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
  The group has developed a number of games using the Wild Magic platform,
  including &quot;Relax To Win&quot;, &quot;Brain-Child&quot; and
  &quot;Mental Leaps&quot;.  Visit the

<h3>Synthetic Characters project at the MIT Media Lab</h3>
<table width=620>
<tr><td>
  A group of folks at the MIT Media Lab have an ongoing project for developing
  <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/characters/">Synthetic Characters</a>
  that exhibit intelligent behavior.  The group is headed by Professor Bruce
  Blumberg.  A demonstration called <i>Alpha Wolf</i> was presented at
  SIGGRAPH 2001 in the Emerging Technologies section.  The graphics foundation
  is a modified version of the Wild Magic engine.  The demonstration is a fine
  example of using graphics to support the main goal, showing the intelligent
  behavior, without drawing attention away from that goal by gratuitous use of
  flashy special effects.  Some screen shots are shown below.

<h3>3D Studio Max Exporter (Version 1.00)</h3>
<table width=620>
<tr><td>
The latest version by Daragh McDonnell of the MIT Media Lab Europe with
support for more features and some bug fixes.  This compiles and runs with
Wild Magic version 1.3, but does not yet have the support for the new
high-level rendering features (exporter updated independently of my WM
development).   Both a
<a href="Resources/Community/3DSMaxExporter/MaxToMgcBinary_v100.zip">binary (*.dle)</a>
and
<a href="Resources/Community/3DSMaxExporter/MaxToMgc_v100.zip">source</a> are available.
If you are now using Visual C++ 7.0, please read the ReadMe.txt file before
compiling the exporter source code.  The zip files expand to
MagicSoftware/WildMagic/Tools/MaxToMgc.  3D Studio Max is a 3D modeling
package from
<a href="http://www.discreet.com/products/3dsmax/">Discreet</a>.
