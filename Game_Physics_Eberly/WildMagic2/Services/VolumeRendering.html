<b>Software volume rendering based on ray tracing</b>.
<br><br>

The algorithm is the classic one where rays are cast through the volumetric
data and the image intensities are accumulated according to various schemes.
The image below shows a ray tracing using Bresenham's 3D line drawing
algorithm to quickly identify voxels whose values are approximately on the
ray.  The data set is an x-ray crystallography image of the superoxide
dismutase molecule.  The trade-off is speed of rendering versus quality of
final image.<br><br>

The image below is a ray tracing where the image intensities along a ray are
an integration assuming trilinear interpolation.  The integration values are
mapped to gray scale intensity.<br><br>

The image below is a ray tracing where the image intensities along a ray are
an integration assuming trilinear interpolation as in the previous example,
but voxels whose values are larger than a specified threshold are colored
with shades of yellow rather than gray scale.<br><br>

The image below is a ray tracing of two images (registered ones in the medical
imaging application) where the image intensities along a ray are
an integration assuming trilinear interpolation.  The images are alpha blended
to allow a user to see two different image modalities superimposed in the
same region.  The example is artificial, the molecule image and an image
with a sphere.<br><br>
