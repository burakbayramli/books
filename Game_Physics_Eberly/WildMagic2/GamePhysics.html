is another book in the Morgan Kaufmann <i>Series in Interactive 3D
Technology</i>.  Please see the
<a href="GamePhysicsBook/TableOfContents.html">Table of Contents</a> for
more details. For a larger image of the book cover, see
<a href="GamePhysicsBook/GamePhysicsL.png">book cover</a> (21K bytes).
As of July 2003, the book is in the production phase of publication.
According to the
<a href="http://www.mkp.com">Morgan Kaufmann Publishers</a> web site,
the publication date will be December 15, 2003.
<br><br>

The CD-ROM contains C++ source code for general physics situations and has
many examples and applications.  The sample applications run on top of the
graphics engine, Wild Magic version 2, whose source code will also be included
on the CD-ROM.  The binding between the Wild Magic data structures and the
physics source code is minimal, thus making it easy to modify for your own
needs.

Finally! Amazon.com is posting nearly all correct information about the book.
The book is listed as <i>not yet released</i> (which is correct) and shows
the publication date as <i>December 2003</i> (which is correct). The list
price is still stated as $74.95 (USD), but Morgan Kaufmann Publishers has a
list price of $69.95 (USD).  The good news is that Amazon is selling the book
for a discounted price of $52.47 (USD) as of August 18, 2003.  Of course, they
might change this at any time, so buy now.  Yes, the book really is appearing
in December!  The production is well under way, and on schedule.
