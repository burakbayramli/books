  <b>Community Links Disclaimer</b>.
  The term <i>"we"</i> refers to the entity Magic Software, Inc.  The term
  <i>"content at this page"</i> refers to anything you download from the
  contributed links on the Community.html page.
  <ul>
    <li>
      We are neither responsible nor liable for any problems that you have
      with any content provided through the community page links.<br><br>

    <li>
      We are not responsible for supporting the content at the community page.
      This is particularly important since our source code base will be
      constantly evolving, possibly causing the content at this page to become
      out of date because it relies on an earlier version of our source.  It
      is essential that your page entry mention the version of the software
      that was used.  We will make available by zip file the previously
      released versions of our source code for convenience.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
      The license agreements for our source code are still valid.  This is
      particularly important if you use the Wild Magic game engine source
      code for your product and wish to make your product available as source.
      The most difficult part of this is if a contributor modifies the Wild
      Magic game engine source and the end user must receive that code.  The
      intention of the "grant" section of the 3D Game Engine license is that
      each end user receiving our source (or modified source) must own a copy
      of the game engine book.  Of course, ownership is effectively
      impossible to enforce through such a contributed links page, so we will
      summarily deny links on this page to any project that allows download
      of our source.  If you choose to distribute our source (modified source)
      with your own source through other channels, the license agreements
      <i>still</i> apply.  In particular, redistribution of Wild Magic game
      engine source requires each recipient to own a copy of the 3D Game
      Engine book.
