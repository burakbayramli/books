Consider a NURBS curve with 13 control points that are initially on the same
straight line.  The knot vector is open with uniformly spaced knots.  The
curve is necessarily a line segment.  The control points must be moved to
deform the central portion of the curve into a closed loop.  The control
weights are all 1 except for points 3, 5, 7, and 9, whose weights are 3/10.
These weights were chosen to produce a final closed loop that is
nearly circular.  The next image shows the initial line segment and its
control points.  It also shows how the control points evolve early in the
process.

The next image shows the control points and curves much further along in
time.  The time sequence is from left to right, then top to bottom.
In the lower left image, control points 1 and 11 finally coincide as do
control points 2 and 6.  At that instant the NURBS curve is split into two
NURBS curves as shown in the lower right image.  The closed curve has a
periodic knot vector.  The closed curve continues to move vertically upwards
by uniform translations of the control points.  The other curve has 5 control
points with points 1 and 3 coinciding.  The curve evolves back to a line
segment by translating the middle control point 2 so that it too coincides
with control points 1 and 3.

The next image shows an entire sequence of frames of the deformation.  The
sequence of images is top row to bottom row, left to right in each row.
