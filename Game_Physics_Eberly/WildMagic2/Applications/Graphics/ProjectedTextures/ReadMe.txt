The program displays the Face data set.  A camera is located and oriented so
that it sees the face.  A texture is projected onto the face based on that
camera's parameters.   Rotate the face with the F1 through F6 keys to see that
the texture does not move.

To navigate the scene by moving the camera:
  UP ARROW    = translate camera along view direction (move forward)
  DOWN ARROW  = translate camera along view direction (move backward)
  LEFT ARROW  = rotate camera about up vector (turn to left)
  RIGHT ARROW = rotate camera about up vector (turn to right)
  HOME        = translate camera along up vector (move up)
  END         = translate camera along up vector (move down)
  PAGE UP     = rotate camera about right vector (look up)
  PAGE DOWN   = rotate camera about right vector (look down)

To tumble the scene (camera remains stationary):
  F1 / F2 KEYS = rotate about global X-vector
  F3 / F4 KEYS = rotate about global Y-vector
  F5 / F6 KEYS = rotate about global Z-vector
