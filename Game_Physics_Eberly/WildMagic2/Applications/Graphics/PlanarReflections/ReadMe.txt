The program draws the evening sky as a screen polygon with maximum depth.
The biped is drawn standing on a rectangle with a water texture.  The
reflection of the biped is shown in the water.  Press the 'g' key to animate
the biped as if he is running on the water.  The motion of the water and sky
are independent and are achieved by "animating" the texture coordinates, not
the geometry.  To restart the animation cycle, press 'G'.
