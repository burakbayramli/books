The program displays the face data set which is just vertex colored.  A light
map is added to the vertex colors using the apply-add mode.  The face now
looks shiny.  Rotate the face with the F1 through F6 keys to see how the face
looks as if the light sources are fixed in space.

To navigate the scene by moving the camera:
  UP ARROW    = translate camera along view direction (move forward)
  DOWN ARROW  = translate camera along view direction (move backward)
  LEFT ARROW  = rotate camera about up vector (turn to left)
  RIGHT ARROW = rotate camera about up vector (turn to right)
  HOME        = translate camera along up vector (move up)
  END         = translate camera along up vector (move down)
  PAGE UP     = rotate camera about right vector (look up)
  PAGE DOWN   = rotate camera about right vector (look down)

To tumble the scene (camera remains stationary):
  F1 / F2 KEYS = rotate about global X-vector
  F3 / F4 KEYS = rotate about global Y-vector
  F5 / F6 KEYS = rotate about global Z-vector
