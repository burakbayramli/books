<h3>Introduction:</h3>

This is a program that lets you view the scene as a tree and in a 3D view. It
allows you change some variables and properties of the scene graph through the
tree view. For example you can change the color of the lights, add another
texture stage or change the blending operations. It supports cutting and
pasting of nodes. You can also save changes made to the scene. You can rotate
around the scene by using the arrow keys.<br><br>

<h3>Usage:</h3>

What follows describes how to add another texture stage to the scene. The
files mentioned below are in the zip file.
<ul>
  <li> Open the file sphere_cloud.mgc.</li>
  <li> Expand the items in the tree view until you find the TextureState
       object.</li>
  <li> Go to the edit menu and choose Add Texture.</li>
  <li> Choose the file cloud_gray.mif.</li>
  <li> Now if you double-click on one of the properties of the Texture, like
       the Apply, you can change the Apply mode.</li>
</ul>
