You could write to Chee Yap (yap@cs.nyu.edu), or easier, retrieve
the journal version of that paper, which appeared two years later:

@article{cy-psppp-86
, author =      "J. S. Chang and C. K. Yap"
, title =       "A polynomial solution for the potato-peeling problem"
, journal =     "Discrete Comput. Geom."
, volume =      1

, pages =       "155--182"
, succeeds =    "cy-psppo-84"
