Not quite.  Either (1) one box face contains a polyhedron face, and
another box face contains an edge, or (2) three box faces each contain a
polyhedron edge.  There are O(n^2) critical positions of type (1) and
O(n^3) critical positions of type (2).  With a careful traversal of all
the critical positions, you can compute the minimum volume box in O(n^3)
time.  Here's the reference:

}

The idea behind the proof is that the coordinate frame of the box must
be 'rigid', otherwise a slight perturbation can make the box smaller. 
Coordinate frames in 3d have 3 degrees of freedom, and (1) and (2) are
the only two ways to remove all three of them.  The same is true (I
believe) for minimum-surface-area boxes, which are more efficient for
ray-shooting than min-volume boxes.  

This is the fastest algorithm known, but there is no real reason to
believe it can't be improved.  In higher dimensions, a similar algorithm
should work in O(n^{d-1 choose 2}) time.

Gill and Sariel actually implemented their algorithms(!!), but you'll
have to beg them for the code.

There was a recent thread in c.g.a covering exactly this topic, but
I'll summarize.

(1) The issue, as you have already discovered, is finding the right
    coordinate frame to define the box edges.

(2) In 2d, Godfreid Toussaint's "rotating caliper" algorithm finds the
    smallest box in O(n log n) time, or O(n) time if you already have
    the convex hull.  This is probably what you meant when you said

    | - rotate all points around vertical to find smallest xy area
    |   occupied by all points.

    The key observation is that some edge of the smallest box contains
    an edge of the convex hull.

(3) In 3d, the fastest algorithm known, due to Joe O'Rourke, runs in
    O(n^3) time, too slow to be practical.  The key observation behind
    the algorithm is that the minimum bounding box either has a hull
    facet and a hull edge, or three hull edges, on independent faces.

(4) There are at least three practical algorithms out there:

    - Brian Mirtich's polyhedral moments code to compute the moments
      of inertia of the convex hull (NOT just the points!).  The
      eigenvectors of the moment matrix define a coordinate frame
      which in practice gives good bounding boxes.  This approach is
      used in many collision-detection packages that use OBB-trees.
      O(n) time, given the convex hull; no theoretical guarantees.

      http://www.acm.org/jgt/papers/Mirtich96/

    - Dave Eberly's numerical code, which converges to (at least) a
      local optimum.

      http://www.magic-software.com/

    - Gill Barequet and Sariel Har-Peled's guaranteed approximation
      algorithms.  O(n/e^2) time, given the convex hull, to get a box
      whose volume is (1+e) times the global minimum, for your
      favorite constant e>0.  You have to beg Gill for the code.
      Here's their paper (to appear in J. Algorithms):

      ftp://ftp.cs.technion.ac.il/pub/barequet/papers/bbx-alg.ps.gz

    Somewhat surprisingly, these three approaches were developed
    completely independently.  Mirtich's algorithm is probably the
    most practical, depsite its lack of theretical guarantees; its
    output could be used as an 'initial guess' for either of the other
    two algorithms.
