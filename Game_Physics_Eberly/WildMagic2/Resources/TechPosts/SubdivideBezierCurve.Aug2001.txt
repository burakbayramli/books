By subdividing the curve at parameter value t you only have to find
the length of a full Bezier curve. 

If you denote the length of the control polygon by L1 i.e.:
    L1 = |P0 P1| +|P1 P2| +|P2 P3| 
and the length of the cord by L0 i.e.:
    L0 = |P0 P3|

then 
    L = 1/2*L0 + 1/2*L1

is a good approximation to the length of the curve, and the difference
    
    ERR = L1-L0

is a measure of the error. If the error is to large, then you just
subdivide curve at parameter value 1/2, and find the length of each
half. 

If m is the number of subdivisions then the error goes to zero as
    2^-4m. 

If you dont have a cubic curve but a curve of degree n then you put

    L = (2*L0 + (n-1)*L1)/(n+1)
