Pluecker Coordinate Tutorial, by Ken Shoemake (ks@emanon.net)

Pluecker 3D line coordinates are concise and efficient for numerous
chores. Dot products and cross products reveal their geometry, without
the need for determinants. For the impatient (and aren't we all a
little?), results come first, then explanations.

On notation: Frequently 3D graphics uses a 3-tuple, (x,y,z), without
concern for whether it represents a vector or a point. When being more
careful, (U:0) will be the homogeneous coordinates of vector U, with U
= (Ux,Uy,Uz), and (P:1) -- or (P:w) -- the homogeneous coordinates of
point P, with P = (Px,Py,Pz). The origin is then (O:1), with O =
(0,0,0), and subtracting it from a point creates a vector. The cross
product PxQ is the 3-tuple (PyQz-PzQy,PzQx-PxQz,PxQy-PyQx), and the
dot product U.V is the number UxVx+UyVy+UzVz. A direction is a vector
with length ignored. A plane has equation ax+by+cz+dw = 0, or D.P+dw =
0, so its coordinates are [a:b:c:d], or [D:d], with D = (a,b,c)
perpendicular to the plane. Planes [D:0] contain the origin. Colon
(":") rather than comma (",") proclaims homogeneity.

Here are common Pluecker 3D line computations collected in one
place. All lines are ordinary Euclidean lines, not projective oddities
like lines at infinity.

  @ L = {U:V}, with 3-tuples U and V, with U.V = 0, and with U
  non-null.

  @ L = {P-Q:PxQ}, for P and Q distinct points on L.  @ L = {U:UxQ},
  for U the direction of L and Q a point on L.  @ L = {qP-pQ:PxQ}, for
  (P:p) and (Q:q) distinct homogeneous points on L.  @ L =
  {ExF:fE-eF}, for [E:e] and [F:f] distinct planes containing L.

  @ {U1:V1} =? s{U2:V2} tests if L1 = {U1:V1} equals L2 = {U2:V2}.  @
  s > 0 if L1 and L2 have same orientation.

  @ (V.V)/(U.U) is the minimum squared distance of L from the origin.
  @ (VxU:U.U) is the point of L closest to the origin.  @ [UxV:V.V] is
  the plane through L perpendicular to its origin plane, for non-null
  V.

  @ (VxN-Un:U.N) is the point where L intersects plane [N:n] not
  parallel to L.  @ [UxP-Vw:V.P] is the plane containing L and point
  (P:w) not on L.  @ [UxN:V.N] is the plane containing L and direction
  N not parallel to L.

  Let N, N1, N2 be unit vectors along the coordinate axes, with U.N
  non-zero.

  @ (VxN:U.N) is a point on L if N is not perpendicular to U.  @ U and
  this point both satisfy a plane equation [E:e] if the plane contains
  L.  @ Represent L as U and this point to transform by
  non-perspective homogeneous matrix.  @ Represent L as two points to
  transform by perspective homogeneous matrix.

  @ [UxN1:V.N1] and [UxN2:V.N2] are distinct planes containing L.  @ P
  satisfies both these plane equations if L contains P.

  @ Pnt(t) = (VxU+tU:U.U) parameterizes points on L.  @ Pln(t) =
  (1-t^2)[UxN1:V.N1]+2t[UxN2:V.N2] parameterizes planes through L.

  @ U1.V2 + U2.V1 =? 0 tests if L1 = {U1:V1} and L2 = {U2:V2} are
        coplanar (intersect).  @ Sum positive if right-handed screw
        takes one into the other; negative if left-handed.  @ U1xU2 =?
        0 tests if lines are parallel.  Let N be a unit vector along a
        coordinate axis, with (U1xU2).N non-zero.  @
        ((V1.N)U2-(V2.N)U1-(V1.U2)N:(U1xU2).N) is the point of
        intersection, if any.

  @ [U1xU2:V1.U2] is the common plane for non-parallel lines.  Let N,
  N1, N2 be unit vectors along the coordinate axes, with U1.N
  non-zero.  @ [(U1.N)V2-(U2.N)V1:(V1xV2).N] is the common plane for
  parallel distinct lines.  @ [U1xN1:V1.N1] is the common plane for
  equal lines through origin.

Here are two related tricks, a lagniappe, as they say in New Orleans.

  Let P be the point (x,y,z).  @ [(-1,0,0):x] and [(0,-1,0):y] and
  [(0,0,-1):z] are independent planes through P.

  Let [E:e] be a plane and N, N1, and N2 unit coordinate axis vectors
        with E.N non-null.  @ Point (-eN:E.N) and distinct direction
        vectors ExN1 and ExN2 lie in the plane.

Note: E.U = 0 if U is a direction vector in plane [E:e]. If P is in
the plane, so is P+U.

Warning: In reality, line intersections, parallelism, and various
other alignments have vanishingly small probability. Small
perturbations destroy them, and so numerical tests may need the
robustness of error bounds.

Now we pause a minute to let the cookbook crowd rush off to write
code. The overachievers may want to drift off to prove everything for
themselves. All gone? Then the rest of us can try to build a little
intuition, so as to understand the results.

The standard determinant definition of Pluecker 3D line coordinates
takes two distinct points on line L, call them P and Q, written
homogeneously in two columns as follows: [Px Qx] row x [Py Qy] row y
[Pz Qz] row z [Pw Qw] row w Make all possible determinants of pairs of
rows. Only six combinations are independent; these are the Pluecker
coordinates. See geometry yet? Probably not. But set the w's to 1, and
look again.

Rows x and w (in that order) give Px-Qx. Also rows y and w give Py-Qy,
and rows z and w give Pz-Qz. So define U = P-Q. That's half the
Pluecker coordinates. Rows y and z give PyQz-PzQy. Hmm, look familiar?
Sure enough, rows z and x, and rows x and y, also give cross product
components. So we define V = PxQ as the other half of the Pluecker
coordinates. Using L = {U:V} = {P-Q:PxQ} we can think geometrically,
not algebraically.

  Example: P = (2,3,7), Q = (2,1,0). Then L = {U:V} =
  {0:2:7:-7:14:-4}.

We just use familiar properties of dot products and cross
products. The dot product of any two vectors A and B is 0 just when
they are perpendicular, and the cross product of A and B is a vector
that always is perpendicular to both A and B (or is null). The squared
length of A is A.A, and A.B = B.A. In contrast, AxB = -BxA, implying
AxA = (0,0,0). Thus AxB nulls any component of B parallel to A, and
rotates the rest of B 90 degrees. When A and B are perpendicular and
of unit length, this implies Bx(AxB) = A = (BxA)xB. Both dot and cross
products distribute over sums and scales, so A.(aB1+bB2) =
a(A.B1)+b(A.B2) and (aA1+bA2)xB = a(A1xB)+b(A2xB), for example.

Now clearly U = P-Q gives the direction of the line; and V = PxQ (if
it's non-null) is perpendicular to the plane through P, Q, and the
origin.  Less obviously, the colon is there because moving P and/or Q
scales U and V together. Think about it. We know P = U+Q, with U some
multiple of a fixed unit vector. But then V = PxQ = (U+Q)xQ = UxQ, so
moving P clearly scales V the same as U. All variation in Q also comes
from adding multiples of U to the point T where a vector from the
origin meets the line perpendicularly; in other words Q = sU+T.  But
that means V = UxQ = Ux(sU+T) = UxT, and T is a fixed point of L that
does not depend on P or Q. So if either P or Q moves, the length of U
changes, and with it the length of V, by the same scale
factor. Clearly we can also generate coordinates directly from a ray
representation, (U,Q), a direction and a point. We know that U is the
direction of L, which we can normalize; then the length of V gives the
minimum distance from L to the origin, ||T||, and so (T.T) =
(V.V)/(U.U).

  Example. P = (2,3,7), Q = (2,-1,-7). Then {U:V} =
           {0:4:14:-14:28:-8}.  Squared distance from origin is
           261/53.  Example. U = (2,1,0), Q = (2,1,0). Then {U:V} =
           {2:1:0:0:0:0}.  Squared distance from origin is 0.

Since a line is uniquely determined by its direction and its vector
displacement from the origin, there is a one to one correspondence
between lines and Pluecker coordinates. Lines in 3D have four degrees
of freedom, but the {U:V} pair has six numbers. Obviously homogeneity
accounts for one freedom. The second comes from the fact that U.V = 0,
so not all pairs are valid lines. Nevertheless, two lines are distinct
if and only if their Pluecker coordinates are linearly
independent. That is, the test for equality is like that for points
given as homogeneous coordinates.

  Example. {0:2:7:-7:14:-4} is the same line as {0:4:14:-14:28:-8}.
  Example. {0:2:7:-7:14:-4} is not the same line as {2:1:0:0:0:0}.

Now still thinking geometrically, look at dual coordinates, defined
from two plane equations of the form ax+by+cz+dw = 0, namely E.P + e =
0 and F.P + f = 0. We know that as vectors E and F are perpendicular
to their respective planes. Clearly ExF, being perpendicular to both,
must be the direction of L, their intersection. Any point P on L
satisfies both equations, and also satisfies the linear combination
(fE-eF).P = 0. Thus the vector fE-eF defines a plane through the
origin that contains L. So miraculously, it turns out that {U:V} =
{ExF:fE-eF}. Assuming neither defining plane passes through the
origin, we can normalize so e and f are 1, and the duality is
{P-Q:PxQ} = {ExF:E-F}.

  Example. [E:e] = [1:0:0:-2] and [F:f] = [0:7:-2:-7]. Then {U:V} =
        {0:2:7:-7:14:-4}.

The striking similarity of the point and plane definitions tell us
Pluecker 3D line coordinates precisely balance these extremes. Many
computational benefits accrue. Also, many questions come in dual
pairs, with the answers for one obtained by swapping U and V in the
answers for the other.

We know, for example, that [V:0] is an origin plane through L (if V is
not null), and that (U:0) is a vector in the direction of L, each
unique.  The point T = (VxU:U.U) of L is perpendicular to (U:0),
meaning T.U = 0, because V = UxT, so VxU = (U.U)T. Dually, the plane
[UxV:V.V] through L is perpendicular to plane [V:0].

  Example. {U:V} = {0:2:7:-7:14:-4}. Then T = (-106:49:14:53) is point
        closest to origin.  Plane perpendicular to [V:0] is
        [106:-49:-14:261].

What point do L and a given plane [N:n] have in common? Consider first
an origin plane, [N:0]. It meets the [V:0] plane in a line of points
(VxN:w), and to meet the [UxV:V.V] plane w must satisfy w(V.V) =
(VxU).(VxN) = (V.V)(U.N). Therefore the common point is (VxN:U.N) when
n is 0, or (VxN-nU:U.N) in general. Dually, the plane that L has in
common with a given point (P:w) is [UxP-wV:V.P]. For a vector (N:0),
this is [UxN:V.N].

  Example. {U:V} = {0:2:7:-7:14:-4} and [N:n] =
        [0:0:1:0]. Intersection is (14:7:0:7).  [N:n] =
        [0:0:1:-7]. Intersection is (14:21:49:7).  (P:w) =
        (2:0:0:1). Common plane is [7:0:0:-14].  (N:0) =
        (1:1:1:0). Common plane is [-5:7:-2:3].

These are important results, so let's take it again more slowly. The
vector (VxN:0) is perpendicular to both V and N, as is any scalar
multiple, (VxN:0)/w. Since [N:0] and [V:0] both contain the origin,
(O:1), they also contain point O + VxN/w, which scales by w to give
(VxN:w) in homogeneous form. Now a point (P:w) lies in plane [UxV:V.V]
if it satisfies the equation (UxV).P+(V.V)w = 0. Noting UxV = -VxU,
this is w(V.V) = (VxU).P. Substituting, the point we want satisfies
w(V.V) = (VxU).(VxN). We deduce w = U.N by showing (VxU).(VxN) =
(V.V)(U.N). The cross product with V rotates and scales plane [V:0],
which contains U, and nulls any component of N parallel to V. Since
the latter contributes nothing to the dot product with U, we have our
desired result. If V is null, (VxN:U.N) is still a point of
intersection, the origin. However when the line and plane are
parallel, they either intersect everywhere or nowhere, and the formula
fails.

From these few formulae we can produce a number of other useful
results. To transform a line by a matrix without perspective, we first
convert the line to (direction,point) form, transform that pair, then
convert the result back to Pluecker form. For this and other reasons
we want the quickest way to find a point on L = {U:V}. For example,
this also gives the necessary data to determine if L lies in a given
plane. Notice that we can easily generate more, using U. (This is
necessary to apply transforms with perspective, which require a pair
of points.) But (VxN:U.N) gives points on L, and choosing N cleverly
will avoid multiplies. Merely find a non-zero component of U, and let
N be a unit vector in that direction.

  Example. {U:V} = {0:2:7:-7:14:-4}. Take N = (0,1,0), giving point
        (4:0:-7:2) on line.  Plane [1:0:0:1] does not contain the
        point, so it does not contain the line.  It does contain
        direction [0:2:7:0], so is parallel to the line.

To test if a point P is on L, we should use two independent plane
equations. The obvious idea is to dualize what we just did using [V:0]
and [UxN:V.N], with N a unit vector in the direction of a non-zero
component of V. Yet this may fail. We always have a non-null U, but
lines through the origin give a null V. Still, we can work with what
we have. Let N, N1, and N2 be unit vectors for the three coordinate
axes, with N in the direction of a non-zero component of, not V, but
U. Then N1 and N2 give two suitable planes, [UxN1:V.N1] and
[UxN2:V.N2].

  Example. {U:V} = {2:1:0:0:0:0}. Take N = (1,0,0), N1 = (0,1,0), N2 =
        (0,0,1), giving planes [0:0:2:0] and [1:-2:0:0] through line.
        Point (2:3:0:1) lies only in the second plane, so is not on
        the line.

Every point on L is a weighted sum of (U:0) and (VxU:U.U), so a
parametric equation for all points on L is Pnt(t) =
(VxU+tU:U.U). Dually, a parametric form for planes through L is Pln(t)
= (1-t^2)[UxN1:V.N1]+2t[UxN2:V.N2], a weighted combination of the two
planes we learned how to generate a moment ago. This latter pair of
weights, 1-t^2 and 2t, is perhaps overly elaborate, but chosen as
points on a rationally parameterized circle (x:y:w) =
(1-t^2:2t:1+t^2). Any way to get all possible ratios of weights will
do.

  Example. {U:V} = {0:2:7:-7:14:-4}. Pnt(t) = (-106:49+2t:14+7t:53).
  Example. {U:V} = {2:1:0:0:0:0}. Pln(t) = [2t:-4t:2(1-t^2):0].

If two lines intersect, they are coplanar. This latter condition we
can test as follows. Suppose L1 = {U1:V1} and L2 = {U2:V2}. The common
plane containing both L1 and U2 is [U1xU2:V1.U2], while that
containing L2 and U1 is [U2xU1:V2.U1]. Since U1xU2 = -U2xU1,
coplanarity demands U1.V2 + U2.V1 = 0. When the two lines are
parallel, U1 and U2 give the same direction and the plane formulae are
invalid, yet the test still works.

If we want a formula for a common plane even so, we can try a linear
combination of V1 and V2 for the normal, since both are perpendicular
to the common direction. Find a non-zero component of U1, and let N be
a unit vector in that direction; then if V1 and V2 are not both null,
use [(U1.N)V2-(U2.N)V1:(V1xV2).N]. Otherwise L1 and L2 are not only
parallel, but identical, and pass through the origin; generate a plane
for L1 using the standard method. Perhaps the reader can devise a
uniform method for generating a common plane, however small
perturbations generally have large consequences for this situation.

We cannot hope to find a point of intersection for parallel lines, but
otherwise a suitable formula is actually the dual,
((V1.N)U2-(V2.N)U1-(V1.U2)N:(U1xU2).N), where N is a unit axis vector
independent of U1 and U2. This is less computation than its size
suggests. It can be derived as the plane through L2 in the direction
N, [U2xN:V2.N], intersected with L1, (V1x(U2xN)-U1(V2.N):U1.(U2xN)),
followed by two cross product identities, Ax(BxC) = (A.C)B-(A.B)C, and
A.(BxC) = (AxB).C. When neither V1 nor V2 is null, the far simpler
formula [V1xV2:U1.V2] will suffice; it is the dual of the common plane
[U1xU2:V1.U2].

  Example. L1 = {0:2:7:-7:14:-4} and L2 = {2:1:0:0:0:0} are coplanar.
            Lines are not parallel.  Common plane is [-7:14:-4:0].
            Taking N = (1,0,0), intersection point is (-14:-7:0:-7).

Tempting as this geometric development is, it conceals the generality
of the algebra. Pluecker 3D line coordinates are only one special case
(albeit a very useful one) of Grassmann coordinates.

Using Grassmann coordinates we can uniformly manage points, lines,
planes, and such (generically, flats) in spaces of any dimension. We
can generate them, intersect them, and so on, with simple
equations. There are fewer special cases, such as lines given by two
points versus point and direction. Three planes through a point or
three points on a plane (in 3D) use the same algebra as two planes
through a line.

Two solid references are Stolfi's doctoral dissertation at Stanford
(and later book), and Hodge and Pedoe's classic multi-volume text,
_Methods of Algebraic Geometry_, available in paperback from
Cambridge.

In 3D, Pluecker line coordinates can be extended to wrenches and
twists, known as screw coordinates. These cleverly employ all six
degrees of freedom to describe forces and motions. The results have
proved useful for kinematic investigations, as described for example
in Mason and Salisbury, _Robot Hands and the Mechanics of
Manipulation_, MIT.

The best explanation of Plucker coordiantes I've seen is in Jorge
Stolfi's book "Oriented Projective Geometry" (Academic Press, 1991). 
I'll try to give a sketch here, but you should really check out Stolfi's
book if you want to learn about these things.

Plucker coordinates are an incredibly useful way of specifying lines and
rays in 3-dimensional space by six-dimensional vectors.  Suppose L is
the oriented line passing through two points with homogeneous
coordinates [a,b,c,d] and [w,x,y,z] -- or with standard Cartesian
coordinates (b/a,c/a,d/a) and (x/w,y/w,z/w) -- in that order.  Then the
Plucker coordinates of L are

	[a*x-b*w, a*y-c*w, b*y-c*x, a*z-d*w, b*z-d*x, c*z-d*y].

Plucker coordinates are homogeneous -- multiplying all six coordinates
by any real number gives you new Plucker coordinates for the same line. 
Also, not every set of six numbers is the Plucker coordinates of a line.
Plucker coordinates [L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6] always satisfy the
following equation:

	L1*L6 - L2*L5 + L3*L4 = 0.

Two oriented lines L and M can interact in three different ways: L might
intersect M, L might go clockwise around M, or L might go
counterclockwise sround M.  Here are some examples:

	     |M              |M              |M
	L    |          L    |          L    |
	-----+----->    ----------->    -----|----->
	     |               |               |
             V               V               V
	 intersect    counterclockwise   clockwise
	     |M              |M              |M
	L    |          L    |          L    |
	<----+-----     <----|------    <-----------
	     |               |               |
             V               V               V

The first and second rows are just diffeerent views of the same lines,
once from the "front" and once from the "back".  Here's what they might
look like if you look straight down line M (shown here as a dot).

	L                                ---------->
	-----o---->     L    o           L    o
	                ---------->
	 intersect    counterclockwise    clockwise


The Plucker coordinates of L and M give you a quick way to test which of
the three it is.

	cw:   L1*M6 - L2*M5 + L3*M4 + L4*M3 - L5*M2 + L6*M1 < 0
	ccw:  L1*M6 - L2*M5 + L3*M4 + L4*M3 - L5*M2 + L6*M1 > 0
	thru: L1*M6 - L2*M5 + L3*M4 + L4*M3 - L5*M2 + L6*M1 = 0

So why is this useful?  Well, suppose you want to test if a ray
intersects a triangle in 3-space.  One way to do this is to represent
the ray and the edges of the triangle with Plucker coordiantes.  The ray
hits the triangle if and only if it hits one of the triangle's edges, or
it's "clockwise" from all three edges, or it's "counterclockwise" from
all three edges.  For example...

	         /^		...in this picture, the ray
	       /  |		is oriented counterclockwise
	--------- | -->		from all three edges, so it
	   /      |		must intersect the triangle.
	  L------->		(The L is an arrowhead!)

So if you use Plucker coordinates, ray shooting tests like this take
only about ten lines of code.
