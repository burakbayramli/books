Many thanks to Kekoa Proudfoot, David Holz and
Henry Baker for their hints and pointers.
After posting my article, i picked up a pencil and
derived it on my own. Currently my 3D-shear-rotation
needs multiplication of 9 shear-matrices:
Rotate around Y-axis in 3D:
_              _   _             _   _             _
| 1  0 sx  0 |   | 1  0  0  0 |   | 1  0 sx' 0 |
| 0  1  0   0 |   | 0  1  0  0 |   |0  1  0  0 |
| 0  0  1   0 |   |sz 0  1  0 |   | 0  0  1  0 |
| 0  0  0   1 |   | 0  0  0  1|    |0  0  0  1 |
--              --   --             --    --            --
     _                            _
     | cos(a)  0  sin(a)  0 |
== |    0       1     0     0 |
     | -sin(a)   0 cos(a) 0 |    where "a" is the rotation-angle.
     |    0       0     0     1 |
     ---                          ---

Solving for sx, sx' and sz gives
  sx = -(cos(a) - 1) / sin(a) = tan(a / 2)
  sx' = sx
  sz = -sin(a)

Similiar for rotations around X- and Z-axis.
Doing so gives 9 shear-matrices.
Now my new question is:
 Is it possible to simplify the multiplication
of  the 9 shear-matrices in a way to use only
2-axis-shears. In the above derivation i used
shear-matrices that keep 2 axis invariant. Now
i want to simplify the net-multiplication by using
shear-matrices that keep just one axis invariant.

Does anyone have an idea if this is possible and
how this could be done.

Any help again highly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for all help.
