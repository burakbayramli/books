Thanks. I've not looked at such things recently, but I didn't remember
this trick. Using your reference, though, I turned up two citations:

  E. Lee, "On Choosing Nodes in Parametric Curve Interpolation",
    SIAM Conference on Applied Geometry, Albany, New York, 1985

  LEE, E. T. Y. Choosing nodes in parametric curve interpolation.
    Computer Aided Design 21, 6 (August 1989), 363--370

It's also called "centripetal parameterization", and nice discussions
of this and other options can be found here:
  <http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/~heidrich/Thesis/master.ps.gz>
Heidrich, incidentally, studied with Bartels at Waterloo. Small world.

That said, I'd like to make two comments for the benefit of OP and
lurkers. (1) Overshoot is an ill-defined term. Worst case, you may
have to restrict yourself to linear movement between control points!
(2) Parameter spacing is a "black art". A variety of methods have been
proposed and used, but no universal "best" method exists, that I know.

Consider using a different parameterization.  There's nothing magic
about using uniform parameter values (t= 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, ...),
except that it makes the exposition in the text book simpler.

First, make the changes necessary to use arbitrary parameter values at
the knot points (t = t1, t2,t3,..., with t1 < t2 < t3...).

Then consider strategies for assigning parameter values.  You have
already implemented uniform knot values, and discovered that it's not
pretty.  How about using chord length (measure the distance between the
<x,y,z> points and assign parameter values to match)?  I think you'll
find that this is also not pretty (but in a different way).  Now, throw
in a complication: assign parameter values proportional to the distance
between knot points raised to an arbitrary power.  Notice that if the
power is 0 you have uniform knot spacing, and if the power is 1 you have 
chord length parameterization.  How about setting the power to 0.5?

Huzzah!  That will look beautiful!  Why is that?  Sorry, that's beyond
the scope of this discussion.

Careful now - there are lots of pesky details (translation - you'll have 
to modify the basic interpolation code).  But, once you fix the low
level code to deal with non-uniform knot spacing, the rest will be easy.

No, I don't recall any more than that.  I retrieved that info from code
I last modified on 22 November 1989.  Seems to me that I recall seeing
this as an unpublished tech report.
