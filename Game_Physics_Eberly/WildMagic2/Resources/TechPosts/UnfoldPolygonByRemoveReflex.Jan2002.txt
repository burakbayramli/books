Yes.

Look at the difference between the polygon and its convex hull -- it is a 
collection of polygonal pockets, each of which has one hull edge and the 
rest of the edges are from your original polygon.  Pick any pocket and 
triangulate it.  If it is a single triangle, you are done, else there are 
at least two ears (triangles connected to the rest of the triangulation by 
a single edge. At most one of these ears can use the convex hull edge and 
the other ear gives you the diagonal you want.

Yes.  Find the polygon's convex hull.  Find an edge of the convex hull
[x(i), x(j)] which is not one of the polygon's edges.  By the
definition of a nonconvex polygon, such an edge must exist.  This
edge, and the polygon edges 'inside' it form another simple closed
polygon whose interior is completely outside the input polygon.  Any
simple closed polygon can be triangulated without any of the new edges
intersecting the polygon, except at endpoints and completely within
the interior of that polygon.  Any simple polygon has at least two
nonadjacent "ears" that can be clipped (think polygon triangulation). 
At least one of these does not include the convex hull edge, so it
must consist of three adjacent vertices on the input polygon, and the
middle one satisfies the condition you're looking for.  Thus, by
transitivity of hand-waving, the vertex exists.

I wish I could take credit for this, but I only had a vague idea in
which to proceed with the proof, and got the meat via a Google search.
 The source for the proof is here:
