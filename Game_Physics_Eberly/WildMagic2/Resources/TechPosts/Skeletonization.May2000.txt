We are glad to inform that a homepage has now been set describing
what is possibly the simplest approach to obtaining high quality
multiscale skeletons, which are 8-connected and present segments
with unitary width.

The method, based on the concept of exact dilations, allows the
simultaneous determination of the exact Euclidean distance transform
and exact label propagation.  The obtained family of multiscale
skeletons presents the distinctive feature that a series
reconstruction of the shape can be obtained where small scale
information is removed while preserving the position of larger scale
details of the shape.  In addition, the homotopy of the shapes are
conserved (in the sense that the shape is not broken).  The application
potential of this methodology is vast and includes shape analysis,
biology, material sciences, line drawing analysis, visual perception,
and many, many more.

The page, which can be found at

       http://cyvision.if.sc.usp.br/msskeletons/

includes a description of the methods, pseudo-codes, animations,
a downloadable interactive demo, and references.

Comments and suggestions are very welcomed.

Best wishes, Luciano and Leandro

There is a huge number of skeletonization algorithms.   If you are
interested in an algorithm which is independent of the order
used for processing the image pixels, you may be interested in the
following paper:
