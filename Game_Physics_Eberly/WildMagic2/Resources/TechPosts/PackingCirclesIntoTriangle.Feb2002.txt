For equilateral triangles and low numbers of circles there are known
proven optimal solutions. See the "Circles in Triangles" page in Erich
Friedman's Packing Center:
http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/cirintri/
The general problem poses a difficult optimization problem, see Ivars
Peterson's MathLand article "Pennies in a Tray":
http://www.maa.org/mathland/mathland_11_25.html
with references to the work of Lubachevsky and Graham.

One little amendment to my previous post: An article by R.L. Graham
and B.D. Lubachevsky, "Dense Packings of Equal Disks in an Equilateral
Triangle: From 22 to 34 and Beyond", The Electronic Journal of
Combinatorics 2 (1995), #A1 is available online:
