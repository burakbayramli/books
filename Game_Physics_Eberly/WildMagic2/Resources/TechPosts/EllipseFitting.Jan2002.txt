Hi,

Ellipse fitting is one of the most investigated and applied curve
fitting algorithm. There are two main categories for ellipse fitting,
algebraic and geometric fitting.

The algebraic fitting minimizes the square sum of the algebraic
distances between the given points and the conic curve which includes
ellipse, hyperbola, and parabola (i.e. algebraic fitting estimates
algebraic parameters which minimize the sum of the quadric equation
values at each given point).
The advantage of the algebraic fitting is the low implementation and
computing cost. However, there is no guarantee that the estimated
algebraic parameters represent the intended ellipse. A remedy
constraining the algebraic parameters to represent an ellipse is the
algorithm of Fitzgibbon et al. Another disadvantage of the algebraic
fitting is that the algebraic fitting error generally has no physical
interpretation, i.e. we don't know what the algebraic error means in
real applications.

On the other hand, the geometric fitting minimizes the square sum of
the shortest distances between the given points and the conic curve.
This error definition is definitively very natural and preferable
(clear physical interpretation!). Unfortunately, the geometric error
generally has nonlinear nature with the estimation parameters.

A century ago, Pearson has elegantly solved in a closed form (moment
method, eigenvalue method) the problem of geometric fitting of line
and plane in space. However, for general curve and surface, there are
only a few geometric fitting algorithms. There are two real tasks for
geometric fitting, first, determining the shortest distances between
the given points and the curve, and next, finding the curve parameters
minimizing the distance sum. The geometric fitting of general curve
and surface is a current research subject in various fields of science
and engineering, e.g. computer/machine vision, computer aided
geometric design, etc.

Common questions both for algebraic and geometric fitting are how to
extract the physical parameters, e.g. the five ellipse parameters
(axis lengths, center position, and rotation angle), from the
estimated algebraic parameters, and how to test the reliability of the
estimated physical parameters.

Ok, please let me shortly note problems of general curve/surface
fitting.

There are three ways to describe an analytic curve/surface, namely
explicit, implicit, and parametric curve/surface.

y = f(a, x)    : explicit 2D-curve with feature parameters vector a.
z = f(a, x, y) : explicit surface.
f(a, x, y) = 0    : implicit 2D-curve.
f(a, x, y, z) = 0 : implicit surface.
{ f(a, x, y, z) = 0, g(b, x, y, z) = 0 }
                  : 3D-curve as the inters. of two implicit surfaces.
{ x = x(a, u), y = y(a, u) } : parametric 2D-curve with parameter u.
{ x = x(a, u), y = y(a, u), z = z(a, u) }  : parametric 3D-curve.
{ x = x(a, u, v), y = y(a, u, v), z = z(a, u, v) }
                             : param. surface with parameter u and v.

It is clear that any explicit curve/surface can be simply converted to
implicit or parametric one.
E.g. explicit surface z = f(a, x, y) can be converted
to implicit one ( z - f(a, x, y) ) = 0, or
to parametric one { x = u, y = v, z = f(a, u, v) }.
Additionally, the use of explicit curve/surface is very restricted
with real applications of e.g. image processing, pattern recognition,
and computer/machine vision e.g. because a full circle/sphere can not
be described in explicit form. Thus, explicit curve/surface has little
interest for us. If we could solve the fitting problems of implicit
and parametric curve/surface, we can generally fit analytical
curve/surface.

There are various methods and strategies for curve/surface fitting,
e.g. Hough transform, moment method, and least squares method, etc.
In this note, I like to describe only the least squares fitting
methods.
The phrase "least squares" means we estimate (find) the feature
parameters by minimizing the square sum of some predefined
error-of-fit. Thus first, we have to define the fitting error, and
next, find an appropriate searching method for the feature parameters
which minimize the square sum of the errors.
 
A very representative class of implicit curve/surface is the algebraic
curve/surface, i.e. curves/surfaces that are described by polynomials
(quadric, cubic, quartic, etc.).
A simple and good idea for fitting of algebraic curve/surface is to
minimize the square sum of the algebraic function values at each given
point (xi, yi, zi), i = 0, ... , m. (This method is named as
'algebraic fitting'):

   min sum (f(a, xi, yi, zi))^2 ,
   e.g.  min sum ( (xi - xc)^2 + (yi - yc)^2 - r^2 )^2
   for circle fitting (center xc, yc, and radius r).

   I. Kåsa, A Circle Fitting Procedure and its Error Analysis,
   IEEE Trans. Instrum. and Measurement, vol. 25, pp. 8-14, 1976.

The algebraic fitting problem can be solved in closed form at a low
implementation and computing cost.
In particular for circle fitting, the algebraic fitting errors can be
interpreted as the area differences between the fitted circle and the
concentric circles passing through the given points. However, we can
hardly find a physical interpretation for algebraic error with general
implicit curve/surface.

A better and natural error definition would be the shortest distance
(geometric distance, euclidean distance) between the implicit
curve/surface and the given points (named as geometric fitting,
orthogonal distance fitting, error-in-variance fitting, total least
squares fitting, or best fitting).

Another viewpoint is whether the feature parameters could be
simultaneously estimated in terms of form (invariant to the
translation and rotation of the model feature), position, and rotation
parameters, e.g. two axis lengths a, b, center position xc, yc, and
rotation angle alpha for an general ellipse in plane.
Furthermore, a fitting algorithm will be very advantageous, if the
reliability (variance) of the estimated parameters could be tested.

The description of the geometric fitting is beyond the range of this
short note. Instead, some research papers are available:
