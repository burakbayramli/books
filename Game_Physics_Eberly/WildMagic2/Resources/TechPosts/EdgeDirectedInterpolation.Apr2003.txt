This is somewhat interesting. Different algorithm, but it is simple
and delivers very good results in some cases. However it has too
many drawbacks to be used as a general resizing algorithm.

I am not very deep into that field  however that was interesting to read. 
Another approach by Joachim Weickert might be interesting for you. He uses 
tensor based algorithms which are able to extract the structures of 
extremely noisy images. Simply search the web for 'Weickert' and 'tensor' 
or use the references below.

Tensors give you the direction in which the structures remains the same and 
the orthogonal vector in whcih the image 'changes most'. Weickert has 
developed a iterative approach which improves existing structures in every 
cycle.
