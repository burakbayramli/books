I mumbled something about "helical angles" earlier on Saturday
morning. As I said, this representation is being used by people
in the fields of biomechanics and human/animal movement science.
I haven't really looked at it myself, I've just 'filed' the
knowledge of its existance in the back of my head.

There's a mailing list for biomechanics that is archived here:

http://isb.ri.ccf.org/biomch-l/

and if you do a search for "helical" and/or Woltring you'll find,
amongst other things, an interesting discussion between Woltring
and Grood on the value of helical angles, starting with these
two articles from February 1990:

http://isb.ri.ccf.org/biomch-l/archives/biomch-l-1990-02/00020.html

It is possible to locate the involved math by browsing the
archives for that and following months, but a shortcut is
probably this page:

As a side-note, an interesting summary of representations for
orientation is here:

http://guardian.curtin.edu.au/cga/faq/angles.html

interesting, for example, in the sense of the differentiation
made between the Cardan and Euler representations. I always
called eg. rotation by XYZ an Euler angle representation, but
perhaps I should start calling it a Cardan representation?
