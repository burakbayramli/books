 We have a new algorithm and its implementation that
approximates the 3d  medial axis from the Voronoi diagrams.
The algorithm has convergence guarantee and other features.
The description of the algorithm can be obtained from
our paper that is going to appear in this year's
ACM Solid Modeling conference.

 Approximate medial axis as a Voronoi subcomplex
 T. K. Dey and W. Zhao. ACM Solid Modeling, 2002, to appear.

 If you have a polygonal mesh, you can sample the mesh
(I mean sample each planar face) to generate more points
on the surface and then apply the code we have. It approximates
the medial axis quite well if the input sample is dense.

 Look at
