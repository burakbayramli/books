This is probably useless, as it is focussed on exact shortest paths for
theoretical purposes, but it might give you ideas and references to
explore:

	Biliana Kaneva and J. O'Rourke,
	"An Implementation of Chen & Han's Shortest Paths Algorithm"
	in
	Proc. of the 12th Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry
	New Brunswick, August 2000, pp. 139-146.

    You might want to try the following:

        - Minimalistic 3D Obstacle Avoidance Behavior from Simulated
Evolution

        - Bjorn Reese's Navigational Overview page
        http://www.red3d.com/breese/navigation.html

    Those should get you going. If you need more links, look at the web for
"robotic pathfinding" links...robots have to deal with these problems all
the time so it translates well into games.
