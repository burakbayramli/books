In this case, you want to use a coordinate system for
the near plane.  E is the eye point.  The near plane
has unit length normal W and E is on the negative side
of the plane.  The origin of the coordinate system is
P = E+n*W.  At P, you have a unit-length up vector
U.  The third vector is V = Cross(W,U) and points
to the right as you look at the near plane from the
eye point.

The viewport is defined in terms of the coordinate
system.  The four vertices of the viewport on the near
plane are P+ell*V+b*U, P+ell*V+t*U, P+r*V+b*U,
and P+r*V+t*V.  The far plane has normal W and
the corresponding "origin" on that plane is Q = E+f*W.
Let s = f/n.  The four vertices of the frustum on the far
plane are Q+s*(ell*V+b*U), Q+s*(ell*V+t*U),
Q+s*(r*V+t*U), Q+s*(r*V+b*U).
