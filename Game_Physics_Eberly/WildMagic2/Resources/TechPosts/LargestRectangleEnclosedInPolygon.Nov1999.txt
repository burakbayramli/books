This usually goes under the name the "largest empty rectangle"
problem in the more general setting where the obstacles are a
set of points rather than a polygon boundary.  Perhaps this
paper below cites much of the relevant literature.

Some of the most recent work has come from the applications to packing:

Or this one:

Helmut Alt, David Hsu, Jack Snoeyink
Computing the Largest Inscribed Isothetic Rectangle, 1994.

In case you wonder, "isothetic" is a snobbish way of saying
"axis-aligned".
