This should be in the FAQ, since it gets asked every month or two.

Let the masses be m0, m1, the radii r0, r1, the initial center
positions P0, P1 and the velocities V0, V1.  Quantities with
upper case letters in their names are vectors.  All others
are scalars.  We will use the facts that the kinetic energy
of a mass m travelling at velocity V is .5*m*V.V (V.V is the
dot product of V and V) and its momentum is m*V, along with
the laws of conservation of momentum and energy.

The positions of the spheres at time t are P0+t*V0, P1+t*V1.
The spheres collide when
	|P1+t*V1-(P0+t*V0)|=r0+r1,
that is, when
	t^2*(V1-V0).(V1-V0)+2*t*(V1-V0).(P1-P0)+(P1-P0).(P1-P0)-(r0+r1)^2=0
This is a quadratic equation that you can easily solve for t.
Being quadratic it has two solutions, which may be positive, negative or
complex.  If the solutions are complex, the two spheres never collide.
If the solutions are real, they are the times at which the
spheres would start and finish overlapping if they were allowed
to pass through one another.  If both are negative, the spheres
are moving apart.  If one is negative, they currently intersect.
If both are positive, they are moving toward each other, and the
smaller solution is the time of collision.

In a frictionless collision, momentum is transferred from sphere
to sphere only in the direction normal to the surfaces at the
collision point.  Since the objects are spheres, this is just the
vector joining the centers,

	D=P1+t*V1-P0+t*V0

Let's call the momentum vectors before and after the collision
M0b, M1b, M0a and M1a, where M0b=m0*V0 and M1b=m1*V1.  In all
collisions, momentum is conserved, so

	M0b+M1b=M0a+M1a

or

	M0a-M0b=M1b-M1a=s*D

So
	M0a=M0b+s*D
	M1a=M0a-s*D

and the velocities V0a and V1a after the collision are
	V0a=M0a/m0=V0+s*D/m0		(*)
	V1a=M1a/m1=V1-s*D/m1		(*)

Energy is also also conserved, so

	m0*V0.V0+m1*V1.V1=m0*(V0+s*D/m0).(V0+s*D/m0)+m1*(V1-s*D/m1).(V1-s*D/m1)

or
	s^2*(D.D/m0+D.D/m1)+s*2*D.(V0-V1)=0

This quadratic equation in s is easily solved by factoring:
	s=0
or	s=2*D.(V1-V0)/(D.D/m0+D.D/m1)

The two solutions correspond to the situation immediately before
and immediately after the collision.  The non-zero solution, when
substituted into the equations marked (*) tells us the velocities
after the collision.

The solution is the same whether you're working in two or
three dimensions.
