Surface Flattening is a complex problem. It is often referred to as the
mapmaker problem. So, literature pertaining to this problem can be found
among cartography literature or geophysisics. It is also, and that is my
research field, a problem in obtaining 2D maps of the human cortex.

First of all, you have to ensure that the geometry you wish to flatten
is topologically equivalent to a sphere, that is it contains no holes
etc.Generally, you have cannot find an exact mapping from a curved
sphere to a 2D map. You can either try to minimize the error regarding a
length or area metric or try to preserve angles. The latter one is
called a conformal mapping.

Here, is  a short list of references in the field of brain flattening:

problem: Flattening nonconvex polyhedral surfaces,

and a mathematically more involved approach:

'99.

Good Luck,

                 generating an initial planar development of a doubly

                 supported by a set of indices for measuring the
                 accuracy of the flattened component. The first one is
                 based on the surface geometry and the second one on the
                 concept of generalized inverses. By way of
                 illustration, all the proposed methods are presented in
                 parallel with the generation and the refinement of
                 plane patterns of a torus quadrant. In addition, an
                 application of these methods in the 3D surface of a
                 shoe last is demonstrated.",

Okay.

The unfolding problem that computational geometers have looked at the
most is how to create *simple* unfoldings, meaning that the unfolded
surface doesn't have any self-overlaps.

* It is possible to simply unfold any convex polyhedron if you are
allowed to cut through the middle of facets.  I believe there are two
different methods known (but Joe should confirm that).  The older one,
called the "star unfolding", was discovered in 1993 by Joe O'Rourke and
others.

* Nobody knows if it is possible to unfold every convex polyhedron by
cutting only along its edges.  There is a Mathematica package by Komei
Fukuda that simply tries all possible unfoldings until it finds a simple
one -- so far, it has always succeeded, but nobody has proved that it
always will.

ftp://ftp.ifor.math.ethz.ch/pub/fukuda/mathematica/UnfoldPolytope.tar.Z

* It's not hard to come up with examples of non-convex polyhedra that
cannot be unfolded without overlaps, unless you cut through the faces. 
Recently Erik Demaine and others constructed examples of non-convex
polyhedra, all of whose faces are triangles, that cannot be unfolded. 
These examples all have the topology of the sphere.  See Erik's papers:

	http://daisy.uwaterloo.ca/~eddemain/talks/CGC99/
	http://daisy.uwaterloo.ca:80/~eddemain/papers/CCCG99b/

Erik probably knows more about folding and unfolding problems than
anyone else -- see his other papers for more neat stuff.

* No general algorithm is known to actually "execute" a simple unfolding
-- how you actually move the facets from the folded state to the
unfolded state without any collisions along he way?  One simple
heuristic that seems to work for convex polyhedra is to open every fold
at a constant rate, so that they all become flat simultaneously.  My
guess is that this does not always work, but I don't have a
counterexample.  For nonconvex polyhedra, there are probably simple
unfoldings that cannot be executed at all.


> I think Jeff recently published something on this topic.

Sadly, no.  I have folding problems out the wazoo, but no results of my
own.
