As Newton wrote to Hooke in 1676, "If I have seen further it is by
standing on the shoulders of giants." -- I have read the FAQ! [Well,
that and Google and perhaps a little more. ;)]

Speaking of which, perhaps you should submit the NURBS book, ISBN
1-55860-669-6, to O'Rourke for the references section of the FAQ,
"Subject 0.04: What are some must-have books on graphics algorithms?"
You could also mention the associated web page with tutorial C code,
  <http://www.nar-associates.com/nurbs/c_code.html>.
Unfortunately, there seems to be no trimming.

I'm still partial to Farin's book,  ISBN 1-55860-737-4, from the same
publisher, already mentioned in the FAQ (though it's now progressed to
its 5th edition). He also has a book, not mentioned in the FAQ,
specifically on NURBS, ISBN 1-56881-084-9.

I cannot speak from first-hand use, but based on previous work by
Wayne Tiller, one of the first people to write about rational curves
in computer graphics, I'd suggest looking at his book with Les Piegl,
"The NURBS Book", ISBN 3-540-61545-8.

For the uninitiated, the "rational" in Non-Uniform Rational B-splines
has nothing to do with "logical". It refers to using a ratio of
polynomials. The classic example is a half circle:
  t |--> (1-t^2 : 2t : 1+t^2),    t in [-1,+1]
The coordinates are not (x,y,z), but homogeneous (x:y:w), so the curve
lies in the x,y plane. Rewritten in terms of a B-spline basis, this is
one of the main motivations for rationality; otherwise, you can't get
a perfect circle, or a lathed surface.
  x^2 + y^2 = (1-2*t^2+t^4) + 4*t^2 = 1+2*t^2+t^4 = w^2
so
  ||(x/w,y/w)|| = 1.

I believe the OpenGL Utility Library has trimmed NURBS support. And I
might also mention the paper
  <ftp://ftp.cs.unc.edu/pub/users/manocha/PAPERS/RENDER/render.pdf>
