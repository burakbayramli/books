I've looked into it further, and I'm convinced it's wrong.  Imagine
the hover craft is a ring.  A rings linear inertia (resistance to
being moved in a line) is equal to the mass of the ring.  The rings
rotational inertia (resistance to being rotated) is "equivalent" to
the mass of the ring, So if you put the thruster on the radius of the
ring with the thrust vector perpendicular to line from the thruster to
the CG, in the above code you get 100% of the thrust going into
counteracting 100% of the linear inertia (FB+= body->PThrust) and 100%
of the thrust going into counteracting 100% of the rotational inertia.
So you're ending up putting 200% thrust into counteracting all the
inertia (200% of the mass).  You should have 100% of the thrust going
into counteracting the total inertia (200% of the mass). I think what
should happen is 50% of the thrust should go into counteracting the
linear inertia and 50% should go into counteracting the rotational
inertia.  If the thruster is at the center of the ring 100% of the
thrust should go into counteracting the linear inertia (100% of the
mass) and 0% of the thrust should go into counteracting the rotational
inertia, this does happen with the above code.

So what the code needs is something to calculate what portion of the
thrust affects each type of inertia.

     This is more easily thought of in energy terms.
The ring, at a given RPM, stores more energy than a
disk of equal mass, because its moment of inertia
is larger.  More mass is being moved through a longer
distance.

     The total energy stored in the object is the
energy stored in its angular motion plus the energy
stored in its linear motion.  When the objects roll
down the ramp, more energy is required to
accelerate the ring rotationally,
which takes away from its linear acceleratino.

     Feynman writes in one of his books that he
found a high school physics text that got this wrong.
What really annoyed him is that they gave "experimental"
data for this experiment which the authors had
actually computed (wrongly), which is dishonest.
