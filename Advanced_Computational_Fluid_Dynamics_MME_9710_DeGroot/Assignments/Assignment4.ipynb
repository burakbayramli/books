Problems 1-2 should be solved for a 4 [m] long, 0.02 $\\times$ 0.02 [m] cross-section duct discretized using 10 equal-length control-volumes.  Also, for simplicity, use UDS as your advection scheme for problems 1-2.  Higher-order advection schemes are considered in question 3.\n",

Do one time step (using any time step size) and make sure that your code accepts this as the exact solution.  Repeat this problem with $u = \\hat{u} = -10$ [m/s] to ensure that your code has no directional dependence.  Describe the boundary conditions used for the two cases, including the values of $\\alpha_e$."

Impose suitable boundary conditions on the ends of the duct and initialize the problem with $u = \\hat{u} = 10$ [m/s] and $p = 0$ [Pa].  Check that the pressure is exactly correct after emerging from enough iterations by comparing your result with the exact solution calculated from the above expressions.

Keep the general structure of the class, but modify the calculation of the areas and volumes appropriately. The inlet velocity should be imposed as $u=2$ [m/s].  To eliminate friction in the duct, be sure to turn off the wall friction terms from the previous problem.  Solve the problem using 8, 16, 32 and 64 equal-length control-volumes and calculate the loss in dynamic head from each converged solution.  The dynamic head loss is given as:\n",
