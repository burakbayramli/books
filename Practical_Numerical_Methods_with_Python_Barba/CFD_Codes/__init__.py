This project contains python code I wrote to further my understanding of and ability to implement the numerical methods used in
computational fluid dynamics. The project currently consists of static classes used to model different physical phenomena in fluid
systems.

Some of the work in this repository is based on tutorials and numerical methods I have found online or come across
in my work. The main contributors are listed below:

1. Lorena A. Barba - CFD Python: 12 Steps to Navier-Stokes
2. Eleuterio F. Toro - Riemann Solvers and Numerical Methods for Fluid Dynamics
3. J. F. Manwell - Wind Energy Explained
