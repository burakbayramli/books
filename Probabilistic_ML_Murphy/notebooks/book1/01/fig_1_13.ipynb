    "(a) Visualization of the Fashion-MNIST dataset \\citep{fashion}. The dataset has the same size as MNIST, but is harder to classify. There are 10 classes: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle-boot. We show the first 25 images from the training set. Generated by [fashion_viz_tf.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book1/01/fashion_viz_tf.ipynb) . (b) Some images from the CIFAR-10 dataset \\citep{Krizhevsky2009}. Each image is $32 \\times 32 \\times 3$, where the final dimension of size 3 refers to RGB. There are 50k training examples and 10k test examples. There are 10 classes: plane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. We show the first 25 images from the training set.
