    "(a) Some beta distributions. If $a<1$, we get a ``spike'' on the left, and if $b<1$, we get a ``spike'' on the right. if $a=b=1$, the distribution is uniform. If $a>1$ and $b>1$, the distribution is unimodal. Generated by [beta_dist_plot.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book1/02/beta_dist_plot.ipynb) . (b) Some gamma distributions. If $a\\leq 1$, the mode is at 0, otherwise the mode is away from 0. As we increase the rate $b$, we reduce the horizontal scale, thus squeezing everything leftwards and upwards.
