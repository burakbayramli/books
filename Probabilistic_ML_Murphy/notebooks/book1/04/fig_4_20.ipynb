    "(a) Logistic regression for classifying if an Iris flower is Versicolor ($y=1$) or setosa ($y=0$) using a single input feature $x$ corresponding to sepal length. Labeled points have been (vertically) jittered to avoid overlapping too much. Vertical line is the decision boundary. Generated by [logreg_iris_1d.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book1/04/logreg_iris_1d.ipynb) . (b) Same as (a) but showing posterior distribution. Adapted from Figure 4.4 of \\citep{Martin2018}.
