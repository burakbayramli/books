    "(a) Profiles of ridge coefficients for the prostate cancer example vs bound $B$ on $\\ell _2$ norm of ${{w}}$, so small $B$ (large $\\lambda $) is on the left. The vertical line is the value chosen by 5-fold CV using the 1 standard error rule. Adapted from Figure 3.8 of \\citep{HastieBook}. Generated by [ridgePathProstate.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book1/11/ridgePathProstate.ipynb) . (b) Same as (a) but using $\\ell _1$ norm of ${{w}}$. The x-axis shows the critical values of $\\lambda =1/B$, where the regularization path is discontinuous. Adapted from Figure 3.10 of \\citep{HastieBook}.
