    "Illustration of Newton's method for minimizing a 1d function. (a) The solid curve is the function $\\mathcal{L}(x)$. The dotted line $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{quad}}(\\theta )$ is its second order approximation at $\\theta _t$. The Newton step $d_t$ is what must be added to $\\theta _t$ to get to the minimum of $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{quad}}(\\theta )$. Adapted from Figure 13.4 of \\citep{Vandenberghe06}. Generated by [newtonsMethodMinQuad.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book1/08/newtonsMethodMinQuad.ipynb) . (b) Illustration of Newton's method applied to a nonconvex function. We fit a quadratic function around the current point $\\theta _t$ and move to its stationary point, $\\theta _{t+1} = \\theta _t+ d_t$. Unfortunately, this takes us near a local maximum of $f$, not minimum. This means we need to be careful about the extent of our quadratic approximation.
