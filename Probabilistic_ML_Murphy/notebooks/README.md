This directory contains jupyter notebooks that are used in the "Probabilistic ML" books to generate figures.
The `book1` and `book2` directories contain files for the Intro and Advanced books, respectively.
The `tutorials` directory contains pedagogical notebooks related to software issues (e.g., JAX), 
and is not tied specifically to the book.
The `misc` directory is a dumping ground of non-maintained notebooks :)
