    "The weighted integral formulations of the previous lesson allowed finding approximate solutions to the accompanying governing differential equation.  Similarly, the finite element method is a technique for constructing approximate solutions to differential equations.  To understand the foundations of the method, it is necessary to understand the weighted-integral formulations and the *weak* formulation of the differential equations.  A weak form of a differential equation is equivalent to the governing equation and boundary conditions, i.e. the strong form.  It allows classifying boundary conditions as essential and natural."
